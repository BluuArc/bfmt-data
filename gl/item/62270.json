It enhances its wearer's physical capabilities immensely while also granting limitless regenerative capacity that can compensate for any injury. However, these benefits come at an incredible cost; the armor absorbs life energy from all surrounding beings during combat. It is entirely capable of reducing a verdant field to a lifeless wasteland. It is also said to make its wearer enamored with death in battle, sentencing them to a life of endless combat.",
