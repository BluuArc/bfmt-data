As the city burned, the Raug overlord ordered his remaining minions to burrow under the city, contaminating the soil for ages to come with a mix of human remains and demonic ichor. Soon, the city would spawn new demons even after it was long reclaimed by man. His view of his rivals was thus: \"Malachus deludes herself into thinking that desire is everything one needs. She can keep the delusions of grandeur - at my feet.\""
