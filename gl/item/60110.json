If worn by a normal human, it's said that the human's spirit will be dominated by the demon's residual will, transforming the wearer into a murderous maniac. However, those with a strong will may draw out the regalia's power and demonstrate power on par with a demon. Even so, the regalia vanished to parts unknown after the war with the gods, and no records of its use remain."
