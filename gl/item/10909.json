		"lore": "A nocturnal demon bug said to appear during the downpours of purple miasma in Wulgee. When it has found its prey, this bug emits a demonic light that calls for lightning from the heavens. The lightning then strikes its target directly, rendering it completely numb and paralyzed after the initial pain, which helps the bug to consume it without much effort. Never in one place for too long, the Miasma Bug is constantly moving and wreaking havoc. Many advise that it's best to run after encountering it, as a confrontation could prove far too dangerous."
