Carefully painted on its surface is an emblem depicting a seated figure with two outstretched wings.<br><br>Opinions are divided over what this ancient emblem represents. Some say it is the personal crest of a mythical emperor, whose deeds so moved the Sun God that he was granted wings to soar to the heavens. Others believe they are winged protector spirits called fravashis. These spirits watch over the good and do battle with evil, safeguarding all who live in the material world."
