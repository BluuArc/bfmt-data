		"lore": "Though cracked in several places, this pulsing orb still retains much of the power of a Revenantâ€”a Guardian that has consumed so much debris that its phantom essence exhibits anomalous energy signals. It was theorized that these Guardians were abandoned decades ago by long-dead Guilds.<br><br>After several tests by Noel and Giselle, the energy signals are similar to pulses in the human brain when accessing memories. The Revenants are thus named for being amalgamations of \"deceased memories\", but whether this is scientific fact or supernatural sentiment is a constant topic of debate between them."
