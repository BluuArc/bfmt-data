While wearing that same crown, the man came back to life even after being fatally injured, and eventually went on to build a great empire. However, it is said that when he attempted to be coronated with a new royal crown he was cut by an infinite number of invisible blades, and suffered an agonizing death. The crown was later destroyed by a retainer, but was reformed by a mystical force, and is said to be in the hands of someone even now."
