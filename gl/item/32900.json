However, it is said that through numerous battles the blade produced a celestial glow, unlocking a hidden power from within the swordsman who wielded it. For that reason it came to be known as the Star Blade, but after the swordsman met his fate, from that point forward no one who wielded it was able to unleash it's heavenly glow. "
