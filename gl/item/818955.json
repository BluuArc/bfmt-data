		"lore": "The power that the Blight grants to those who gain his favor may seem unremarkable until it blooms in times of need. Shifting in pattern and hue, it grants the user the strength to rip arrogant gods and ill specters from their thrones. They become heroic adventurers, smashing any and all obstacles in their path. Their accomplishments become legend, even as their bodies start to slowly fail. One day, they simply explode with unexpressed rage as Malekhan's fungi coat everything within reach in thick toxic spores. Just as intended."
