Just as Reda gathers the fragments of heroes' memories, this crystal is believed to hold the feelings she has experienced upon touching those memories. Rumor holds that Noel and Rhynt of the Summoners' Hall refined this crystal in such a manner that touching it can grant a glimpse of ancient heroes' memories.",
