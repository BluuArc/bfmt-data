Some rumors state that the servants under her rule who brought prosperity to that era were being controlled with dark magic. No results yielding from that type of dark research were thought to have survived until an improved version of this demonic tool was uncovered later. This inhumane use of dark magic for experimentation is believed to have continued until it was finally destroyed by the gods.",
