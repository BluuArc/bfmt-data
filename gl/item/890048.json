Said to originate from the domain of Set, the Deceiver.<br><br>In contrast with the fertile black soil where the first humans raised their civilizations, the red soil of the desert was dry, barren, and perpetually scorching. Some compare their vibrant colors to blood; the more superstitious (and dastardly) of Set's followers smear it as a ritual tattoo, believing it is in fact the ichor of the Deceiver."
