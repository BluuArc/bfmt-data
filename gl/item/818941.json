Powdered Sarayagaza Blooms have been added to the device, rendering the wearer immune to fear in the face of danger, and even more powerful in Guild Raids. Some who own this device claim to see a warrior clothed in gold among their enemies during fierce battles, often accompanied by a pale maiden by his side. The saying \"The stars shall shine forever.\" is etched on its rim."
