Similar to other crystallized types of incense, when the instructions for its burning are not followed to the letter, it can have a bad effect on the user, and thus permission to use this item is only granted to Demon Slayers currently on duty. Furthermore, the side effect of this crystal is said to be extreme devitalization."
