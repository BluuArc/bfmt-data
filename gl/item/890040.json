Despite its apparent age, the bronze disc still retains some of its luster, and the skull motif imprinted upon it remains untarnished.<br><br>Death and the celebration of death appears to have been an important part of that civilization, as evidenced by grave goods recovered from the few tombs discovered thus far. The overwhelming presence of gilded skulls suggests that particularly cherished spoils of war or sacrifice are taken into the afterlife."
