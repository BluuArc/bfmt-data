Eldione the wizard created a range of items to help the king he respected in protecting the country. Among his masterpieces, this crystal which prevents its user from becoming weak, getting injured, or being paralyzed, was considered to be his best piece of work. However, without the king's benevolent administration, the country eventually fell to attacks, and the king, ironically, was the only survivor thanks to its power."
