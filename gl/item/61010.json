Large enough to withstand any disaster and with the strength to instantly destroy powerful monsters, it was hated and reviled by humanity. However, Magrahja loved humanity and continued to watch over the people, and left humanity a helm made of his own hide upon his death. The helm holds Magrahja's spiritual strength, and is said to grant its wearer a wide variety of powers."
