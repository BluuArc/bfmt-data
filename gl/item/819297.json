		"lore": "A circlet wreathed in fine silver and accented with gold leaf, proof of a warrior's achievements in the Echo of Athensphere. This one, with its unique centerpiece reminiscent of divine edged wings, belongs to the young demigod Avyn.<br><br>Despite her status as a boundary-traversing demigod, Avyn's spirit remained empathetic to the common people. She insisted that she earn her place among the warriors as they did, refusing to use her powers during the trials. It is due to her grit and determination that the people ultimately rallied behind her during the upheaval."
