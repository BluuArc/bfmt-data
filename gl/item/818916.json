This replica was re-forged by a mysterious smith using lost records retrieved from the lost civilization during its brief reappearance. Heavy and extremely unwieldy, only the most dexterous polearm masters may put it to good use. While inferior to the real artifact, the trident proves to be an excellent conduit of magical energy, granting its bearer an almost limitless amount of stamina."
