Swearing revenge upon the sage, the man who had survived dedicated the rest of his life to honing his skills as a warrior. Using every single opportunity at his disposal to overcome the limits of his swordsmanship and eventually grow to challenge even the gods in expertise, he came to regret but one thing about the path he had chosen: the fact that he himself had turned into the sage he so despised."
