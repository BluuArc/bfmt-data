According to the testimony of a Summoner that fought Balmedia first-hand, its tail was completely ablaze. The beast also had the ability to change its mane into thunder, which hinted that its tail would go ablaze again shortly after. This treasure stumbled upon purely by chance may be the key to Balmedia's ability to transform its tail into fire. "
