This bird had purple feathers with red spots, and was quite common in the Agni region, but the bird that visited the palace that day had red feathers that seemed ablaze. It is said that the people took this as a sign of the gods' blessing upon the emperor, and from that day hailed the seph bird as an auspicious creature."
