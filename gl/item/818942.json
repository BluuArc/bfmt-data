In the hands of a capable fighter, it deftly seeks the gaps in an opponent's armor, as if possessed with a predatory life of its own. Its excitable users claim that bathing it in blood grants them their victims' skills in combat, especially during Guild Raid missions. \"The Empty Sea glitters darkly.\" can be found carved onto the weapon's hilt."
