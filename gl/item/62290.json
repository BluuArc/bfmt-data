The holy king, who destroyed many traitorous enemy tribes, upon realizing that he had reached the end of his natural lifespan chose to shut himself in a temple. Eventually his sorrowful vassal peeked in the temple, but the holy king was nowhere to be seen, and only a single sword remained. The holy king's whereabouts are still unknown, and rumors persist that the sword itself is the holy king's true form."
