Poisoned foodstuffs made the peasantry suddenly fertile beyond belief, and many families soon had several extra mouths to feed - a disaster in the wake of the famine that had plagued the land. Those whose bodies were already weakened by endless celebrations found themselves succumbing to disease, leaving their weak-willed successors foundering in the chaos. Her view of her rivals was thus: \"So pathetically boring. Malekhan likes to count his victories before they even come to pass - which makes his disappointment that much sweeter.\""
