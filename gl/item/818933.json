		"lore": "At a glance, Avani's chainblades seems like a bad joke designed to shred its wielder before he or she can use them. In truth, the blades were designed by Avani herself to subdue the beasts that roam the Baldemar badlands. Forged from orihalcum and treated with a venom concoction extracted from the most venomous beasts of Baldemar, a single wound from the blade or barb from the chains could quickly cripple even the most ferocious of beasts. As if the venom wasn't enough, the oddly serrated edges of the blade could inflict wounds so terrible they never heal. "
