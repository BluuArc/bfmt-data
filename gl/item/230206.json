Lagfarita's soldiers struggled to withstand the mighty barbarians, and the border provinces fell one after another. Then, one day it came to an end when the king brandished this scepter and all the barbarians' attacks were rendered ineffectual. The tide of the war turned suddenly, and Lagfarita was able to drive off the barbarians at last."
