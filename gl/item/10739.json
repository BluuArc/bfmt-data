Adherents claim that the trees of St. Creek absorbed a particularly large share of this factor, and some researchers have begun to focus their experiments on the trees' bark. Should their research bear fruit, it could lead to applications for this mysterious factor in other fields, as well as the restoration of St. Creek itself."
