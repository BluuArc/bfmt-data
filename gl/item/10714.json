Once some of the members of the Demon Slayers took this pelt home to examine it, they rubbed steel against it, and accidentally ended up sharpening the steel. Though it had been believed that this skin served to help the dragon move more rapidly in water, like the skin of a fish, it was proven through this experiment that it could also be used as a terrible weapon.
