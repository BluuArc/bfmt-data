The heart pumps blood at an extremely high temperature, which then travels all around the body with a temperature as high as lava. Strangely, when this heart is exposed to air, it hardens into something resembling a crystal, and stops moving. Though the heart may stop beating, the mysterious heat that emanates from it is still unfathomable."
