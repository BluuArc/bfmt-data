		"lore": "The power that the Blight grants to those who gain his favor may seem unremarkable until it blooms in times of need. Shifting in pattern and hue, it allows the user to create impossible miracles from insane odds. Soon, their feats cause them to be heralded as messiahs and prophets. Their accomplishments become legend, even as their bodies start to slowly fail beneath their notice. One day, their magic pulls them and everything around them for miles into a spore-laden explosion that resounds to the heavens. Just as Malekhan intended."
