The celestial rat had found her niche among the word of mortals as a brilliant—if scatterbrained—inventor of ingenious ideas.<br><br>Charlie's short attention span made it difficult for her to concentrate on any one experiment for long, so when a hypothesis is seen through to its natural conclusion, it's usually because she was struck by a sudden burst of inspiration.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, this liquid tends to form rodentlike shapes—proof that Charlie quite enjoys her nimble true self."
