	"lore": "Before the era of the gods, a unique material was harnessed by otherworldly creatures as an endless source of energy and data. A single drop of this element somehow emerged in Grand Gaia, where it resulted in wild tempests that left brackish pools of water in their wake. Bewildered and worried, the Gods sought to contain this element in a divine vessel crafted from their essence and then dropped it into the deepest rift they could find. Yet rumors say that Akachi, one of the original Shapers of the element, has found the vessel and mounted it onto a gauntlet of power. Why it has done so is anyone's guess, but it can be certain that whoever possesses this shall make their enemies weep in abject hopelessness.",
