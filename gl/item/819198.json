		"lore": "A vibrant, prismatic flower that grows only in the Vale of the North under certain conditions. It gives off a gentle, aromatic scent at full bloom, and its petals appear to glitter and glow at night. Among the Fae, it is a popular gift of friendship among children and adults alike, but it is far more sought after by human druids and scholars.<br><br>Surviving botanical records from Hanukkah festivals during the Vale's brief period of open contact note the flower's many beneficial properties, among them an incredible boost to one's magical abilities."
