Ihsir used the artifact to harness the souls of countless combatants, absorbing their memories to become the master of a thousand magical and martial arts. When he ran out of life force to sustain his magical immortality, Ihsir began to draw upon the strength of other living things to fuel his necromantic magics. Unlike most valuable trinkets, Ihsir was unafraid to leave the skull unattended for extended periods of time. He knew that only a few in the world would be capable of subduing the demonic echoes in the skull to bend its overwhelming puissance to their will.",
