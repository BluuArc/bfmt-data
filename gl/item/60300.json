The demonic power successfully awakened Melord, but at the cost of gradually rotting away his flesh and spirit. When Melord's body finally succumbed to the fusion of demonic and disciple blood, only this crystal remained. Its clarion brilliance and holy aura attest to the unwavering faith Melord had in life for his master."
