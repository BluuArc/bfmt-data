		"lore": "This claw comes from a type of fey beast that dwells in Ohbanahara. Shrouded in pestilence, these beasts brought misery to humanity by spreading disease. Some brave souls attempted to slay them, but most fell to their venomous claws. However, this led to the discovery that the venom in these claws had dark, magical properties. Soon, countless mystics sought to capture the beasts, and the number of victims of their pestilence declined rapidly."
