However, the person the gods decided to bestow the staff upon happened to be none other than the emperor of the nation of Bariura, an empire known throughout history for its long obsession with war. Regardless of whether the successors of the emperor lived for a short or long time after him, they all waged war incessantly either way. This led the staff to lose its initial purpose, and is still the source of much scholarly discussion today.",
