This inhuman thing attaches itself to the user's chest, allowing them at their peak to punch, kick, or strike things dead with a single blow. As long as the wearer enjoys Malachus's patronage, no ill effects will be noticed. However, some have noticed that users become reckless brawlers, attacking everything in reach whenever the opportunity presents itself. Eventually, everything ends for them in the same way: in a beautiful explosion."
