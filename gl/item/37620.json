It may look like an old broadsword, but by influencing the spirit of whomever has equipped it, it grants one the ability to release thunder. Not only does this thunder serve to attack enemies, but it also awakened Eze's physical ability, infusing him with destructive power that even the gods themselves feared. Furthermore, there are reports left that state that the master of this thunder sword will change in appearance as the sword grows with him.",
