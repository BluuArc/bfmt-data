This belies its true ability: a danger-free life filled with opportunities and encounters to live to the fullest. Opportunity bends and coincidence flexes in their favor, making them rise from nobodies into people of interest, surrounded by dead-eyed hordes of admirers and sycophants. Their usefulness eventually comes to an end, and they soon themselves sacrificed to advance one of Maestron's many schemes. After all, everything must go according to plan.",
