Legends say that owning it was proof of a person's status as ruler of the world, but that it was only bestowed upon the being who mas meant to represent a particular era. Its surface, although having been used in battle thousands of times, remains as beautiful and sparkling as ever. In mythical times, legends tell of the hero Oldesekt owning this shield, a name often used to still refer to it. "
