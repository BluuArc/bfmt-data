After three days and three nights of incessant fighting, the dragon emperor came out victorious. However, admiring the warrior's fighting spirit on the battlefield, the dragon emperor took one of the bones in his body and gave it to the warrior, who then fashioned a pair of earrings from it. It is said that once the warrior put on the earrings his courage knew no bounds, slaying countless monsters and becoming a hero of legend afterwards."
