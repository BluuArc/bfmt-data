		"lore": "The power that the Weaver grants to those who gain his favor may seem insignificant, but careful examination reveals its true power. The humble appearance of this token belies its true ability: in exchange for a paltry reduction of one's power and awareness, all but the most hate-laden circumstances will see them free of danger. Opportunity bends and coincidence flexes in favor of the user, typically resulting in them enjoying a rather charmed life. Until they become convenient pawns in Maestron's greater schemes, they will find life quite convenient for them. Their ends, happily enough, are quick and usefully clean."
