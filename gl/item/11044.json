	"lore": "A crystal that was refined inside the body of the Demon Melord. Originally a chunk of amethyst mined from the demon caves in the Wulgee region, Melord's body acted as a catalyst to instill the gem with an evil presence. The crystal emits a foul odor and causes nearby vegetation to decay. What's more, extended use will invite its evil aura to erode the holder's psyche, and could eventually cause complete mental subversion. Many researchers have tried and failed to find a practical application for this challenging material.",
