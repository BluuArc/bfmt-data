It was not until one of the coldest winters known to date passed that it was discovered by a duo who came across it in a forgotten cave, as if the stone had called onto them. Both were immediately ensnared by its power, and a great battle for ownership promptly ensued. Come morning, only one of them walked out of the cave triumphant. The direction the victor took, however, was not towards home, but deeper into the wintertide."
