Similar to the rest of the orbs belonging to the Heresy Series, it was created for the purpose of increasing the survival chances of its wearer. Though it always stimulates the latent abilities of whoever equips it, the entirety of its powers can only be demonstrated through the cooperation of multiple allies in battle. The Infidelity Orb is said to be overflowing with offensive power that heightens the senses of the wearer as he or she fights to protect others."
