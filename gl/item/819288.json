The man—a quiet sort who claimed to be rather out of touch with public affairs—offered him his kettle when Mugen finished what little he could purchase. Mugen was able to catch the kettle when it \"slipped\" from the man's hand, and it was this detail that prompted Mugen to call him out.<br><br>The Tsujigiri would go on to challenge Mugen on the night of the next full moon from this single encounter."
