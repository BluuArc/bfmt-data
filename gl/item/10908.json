		"lore": "A parasite that infects beasts, exponentially increasing their abilities. This parasite injects a stimulant into its host, forcing the host's body to metabolize faster in order for the parasite to drain its energy. Though letting this parasite take over your body may seem like a good idea in theory, its influence causes the muscles to age at an alarming rate. This bug is very rarely found in the corpses of the bodies it usually depraves."
