Though she never showed herself in front of humans, it is said she did trust a princess who loved nature. However, when a plague threatened to wipe out all of the people that the princess held so dearly, the pixie used forbidden demonic powers in order to help her. She then transformed herself into a flower that keeps all illnesses at bay."
