Are those strange shadows shifting inside, or is it merely a trick of the light?<br><br>The rivers are said to carry along the lost memories of souls on their way to Di'yu, and silt deposits are especially sought after as a component in alchemy and magical studies. The emotional intensity of certain memories form glittering pearls among the finer grain."
