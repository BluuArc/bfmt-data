		"lore": "The true form of a legendary garment from the La Veda Republic used for ritualistic purposes. Used as a divine medium to tie two god statues to each other, it was then supposed to be overcome by a great spiritual power which turned it into armor. In ancient times, this mystical armor was worn by the heroes who fought against evil demons, displaying miraculous powers that embodied the gods themselves. However, in the midst of the dreaded battles, one of the statues was lost, and the Monarch Sash was then forgotten in the annals of history."
