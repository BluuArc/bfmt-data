	"lore": "Due to their constant exposure to powerful magic, Barion's wings have an extremely strong affinity for sorcery. This precious material excited researchers due to its ability to act as a virtually lossless conductor for magic. However, as it constitutes a portion of a demon's body, this item is very difficult to gather in large numbers. Thus, it is believed that it will not bring about the technological revolution some researchers hoped for.",
