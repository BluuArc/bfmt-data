		"lore": "The largest of Aurelia's songstones, Orphira features prominently at the head of Aurelia's harp. Songstones are immaculate orbs that radiate gently with the colors of the rainbow, and are said to be the crystallization of divine inspiration. Using the unique resonance of Orphira, Aurelia is able to attune her song to the rhythm of heaven, inducing any emotion she wished in her listeners. During the Augmentation Wars, the songstones were used to amplify the power of her healing hymns. Through Athensphere's darkest hours, Aurelia provided the wounded soldiers with songs of light and hope."
