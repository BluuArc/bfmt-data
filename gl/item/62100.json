The legend tells of a very short period in time when the gods allowed a certain being to rule over everything in their name. This diadem served as proof of the gods' divine decree, and it was adorned with an unwilting flower and an indestructible jewel. However, this is where the story on the tablet ends, as the rest of the story has been lost to time along with the identity of the person to whom the diadem was entrusted."
