General analysis holds that it can protect its wearer from any calamity, but past demonic bearers of the armor died mysteriously in rapid succession. However, recent research indicates that the armor suppresses its wearer's senses of pain and exhaustion. In light of this, many scholars now speculate that these demons drove themselves to destruction due to their race's endless lust for battle."
