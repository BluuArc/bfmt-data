		"lore": "A small pot of violet ink popularly said to be the true 'lifeforce' of the scribes. It has a faintly aromatic scent that reminds one of the riverbank.<br><br>In the age of the gods, violet ink was worth its weight in gold, for it was said to contain the essence of the divine. Only scribes were allowed to use it, and even then, they could only inscribe heka, or hymns to the gods. Under the rule of certain kings, their funerary rites also made use of this ink, though it is unclear whether it was out of religious devotion or sheer hubris."
