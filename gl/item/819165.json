The substance shifts and dances endlessly, imbuing its bearer with boundless energy and enhanced time management skills. Its deepest secrets, however, remain locked to all but a select few who understand and are able to manipulate the intricacies of Time. What should happen if the hourglass is ever broken and the sands unleashed, nobody has even dared to speculate."
