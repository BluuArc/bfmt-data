It has the power to heighten the spiritual powers of its wearer, and to purify all apparitions that attack the wearer. It is said that the cleric accepted the vestments, but returned them after bowing deeply and speaking a single word. Upon hearing this, the gods granted the cleric divine powers in place of the vestments."
