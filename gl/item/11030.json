According to some stories, this Metal God committed a sin that could not be forgiven, and as punishment he was exiled to another world. And though nothing has been found to substantiate this tale, it can't be cast away as pure rumor either. Many theologists believe that there must be a good reason behind the creation of this particular myth."
