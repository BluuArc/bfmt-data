It is said to have been created by a blacksmith with knowledge of otherworldly techniques who had been sought after by the helmet maker Kleinkran, along with other blacksmiths from each region. According to legend, the blacksmith wanted to make a piece of armor that would overwhelm others through its existence alone. The result of his endeavors was a helmet with the ability to reflect enemy attacks, and heal the injuries of its wearer."
