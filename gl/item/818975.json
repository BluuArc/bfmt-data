This inhuman thing attaches itself to the user's chest, allowing them to perform feats known only in legend. As long as the wearer enjoys Malachus's patronage, no ill effects will be noticed. However, some have noticed that users become reckless adrenalin junkies, eager to chase the next near-death high. Their accomplishments typically end in a gore-filled slaughter, with the creature within departing before its demise is reached."
