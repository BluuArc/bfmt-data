		"lore": "A crystal embedded in the hilt of Heresy Demon Kalon's sword. It seems to be no more than decoration at a glance, but a complex crest is engraved within it. This crest normally does not hold any meaning, but its effects become evident when exposed to a specific type of magic. Some theorize that this may be closely connected to the power of the seal that Kalon holds."
