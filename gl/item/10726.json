According to the research of a certain botanist, it was discovered that the bark never actually came unstuck from the tree. Remaining in that state for what seems like an eternity, it is believed that this bark is not made of actual wood, but that its rigidness points to it being some type of armor instead. This particular sort of bark is much stronger than the usual one found from Fairy Trees, and thus great caution is advised when in search of this material."
