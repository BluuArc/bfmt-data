It has unique properties allowing it to hold both profane and divine powers, and it is said that wielders may gain the power to survive in the vortex between the realm of the gods and the underworld. Leto originally crafted it for the next keeper of the gate, but tales say that its unique properties meant that almost none in the realm of the gods could wear it.",
