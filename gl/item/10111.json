		"lore": "The ominous Zeta bird is always challenging beasts stronger than itself, thus earning itself the nickname \"the fighting bird.\" The courageous way of life of this particular bird has always been admired by warriors and heroes since ancient times, serving as a great adornment for many national symbols and family crests. Both the tenacity and gentleness found in its feathers can be used as valuable items for creating weaponry, but there are some adventurers who choose to wear the Zeta Feather by itself as a symbol of bravery."
