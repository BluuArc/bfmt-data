It has been improved upon many times since then, due to the number of malfunctions it experienced and the difficulty of operating its controls. When it was eventually completed, it had become an excellent item for both offense and defense. But even so, it retained a flaw that placed a limit on how long it could be used at full power due to problems with the integrity of its component materials."
