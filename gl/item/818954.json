		"lore": "The power that the Blight grants to those who gain his favor may seem small, but it leaves beautiful blooms in the user's flesh. Shifting in pattern and hue, it takes on many shapes and forms as it grows in power, granting its wielder immense strength and power. Soon, they become capable of heroic feats spoken of in taverns and royal courts, smashing any and all obstacles in their path. Their accomplishments become legend, even as their bodies start to slowly fail beneath their notice. One day, they simply lie down, Malekhan's blooms spreading with their last breaths among those that they held dear. Just as intended."
