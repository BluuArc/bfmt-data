General belief holds that it is only bestowed upon those who have mastered the sword at a level that even the gods acknowledge. The same tales claim it grants its wielder an inexhaustible drive to fight and courage even in the face of overwhelming adversity. And indeed, there are many ancient legends that tell of its wielders sighting an opening to seize victory in the face of certain death."
