The fur would be hardest on nights when the moon was full, making it impermeable to damage from weapons made by the gods themselves. This pelt was collected from that beast during a full moon, and made into armor by the time of the new moon. Its rigidness is unfathomable, but how to collect this pelt, and its manufacturing process, still remain a total mystery.",
