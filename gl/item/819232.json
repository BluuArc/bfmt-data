Painted on its forehead are ritual runes from an ancient, forgotten civilization.<br><br>Tarok viewed his ill-starred existence as both a curse foisted upon him, as well as a blessing to be elevated at the whims of the gods. Savagery was the only way to survive in a world painted red by tooth and claw, and yet there was reverence to be found even in the thrill of the hunt.br><br>Having accepted his role in the grand machinations of his dark deity, Tarok prowls the planes, seeking his next trophy."
