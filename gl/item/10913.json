		"lore": "A variety of insect found in abundance in its native Rokkzalm. The insects' unique secretions are said to promote the circulation of magical energies. Efficient magical energy circulation reduces wear on the bodies of the enchanted puppets found across Rokkzalm, and researchers speculate that it may also help to extend their lives. Accordingly, some scholars even theorize that the enchanted puppets are cultivating magicatalyst bugs themselves."
