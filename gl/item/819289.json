Smells faintly of sunflowers.<br><br>Fuu first met Jin and Mugen in an odd twist of events involving several guards, a restaurant, and a mistaken identity. Nevertheless, the two men were marked for execution, but Fuu's quick thinking broke them out just in time. <br><br>To keep Jin and Mugen from killing each other and leaving her with no bodyguard to find the \"Samurai who smells of Sunflowers,\" she decided on a coin flipâ€”if it comes up heads, they could hack away all they wanted, and if tails, they would stay with her."
