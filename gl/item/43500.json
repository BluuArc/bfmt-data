Those rejected by the sickle are said to have been subjected to poisoning, illnesses, and even curses inflicted by the sickle itself. Whether Graham had the sickle made to fit his personality, or whether he went in search of a weapon that would fit his personal style still remains a mystery. However, whenever Graham laughed, the sickle would reap yet another life."
