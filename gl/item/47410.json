According to legend, the Heaven's Edge was created by beings far more knowledgeable than mere humans, though their existence has been the subject of debate since ancient times. This Sphere is believed to be a remnant of the world that existed before this one, which was supposedly brought into existence before the heavens and the earth were ever created. However, there are currently no methods available to prove such a claim. The only evidence that can support this is the overwhelming power the Heaven's Edge possesses.",
