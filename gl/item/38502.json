The earth, the heavens, the seas, and the moon were all written down along with the names of the gods that rule them. There are some scholars that believe the gods had a master blueprint when they created the universe, but no such thing is found in mythology. Though there are stories that state that this shield was used in the war with the gods, this claim is widely refuted."
