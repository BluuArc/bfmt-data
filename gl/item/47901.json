Whoever possesses this gem is said to feel overwhelmed with power as the energy they intake revitalizes and reinvigorates them for an extended period of time. It is believed to have been made from the remnants of power left behind after the war of the disciples against the demons, but no specific details are known about it. However, if this treasure's power is indeed real, it could come in handy whilst in battle on the land the gods have forsaken."
