		"lore": "A cane topper fashioned after an alpine goat sporting fantastic golden horns. Especially prominent on a certain elfin mountaineer's staff, this topper has become almost synonymous with Alphie, the celestial goat.<br><br> Legend has it that a hunter, seeking the creature's head, lost his way in the vallery in pursuit of his quarry. Just then, two narrow streaks of light cut through the dusk, and led the man safely home to his family.<br><br> As the mist cleared with the dawn, the man realised the truth of his saviorâ€”the same golden-horned goat. Thereafter, the man laid down his hunting arms forever."
