The gods explained that it was against nature to revive the deceased, so the man broke every taboo possible, seeking hidden knowledge to pursue his goal. It was then when he finally created the Godly Staff, which instead of bringing forth miracles, was only capable of awakening a person's hidden life force. Perhaps a miracle is not something that humans can bring forth after all. "
