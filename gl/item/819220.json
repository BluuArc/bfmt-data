	"lore": "A flawlessly clear orb that resembles an eye. Its ley lines shift and transform at the will of the wielder. A black ellipse at the center of the orb, like the pupil of an eye, swivels around merrily as if pleased. After consuming considerable amounts of Orebi crystals, the orb attained its current form, refusing to absorb any more magic. Noel noted that he could no longer detect the subtle malevolence that previously seeped out from the orb. Noel believes that the orb has a sentience of its ownâ€”one that seeks to siphon latent energy from its user, and suggests caution when handling it for long periods of time.",
