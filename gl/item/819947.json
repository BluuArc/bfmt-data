		"lore": "The siege of Rehdoon was a victory for the Raug, made possible by the tenous cooperation between the three demonic overlords. Maestron organized much of the planning and was instrumental in gathering the necessary information to make the invasion succeed, as well as enmeshing the agents of the Inquisition in false plans that eroded their usefulness. With the defenses of mankind subverted, the Raug overlords began the next stage of their plans. Youngest of the three Raug overlords, Maestron revels in manipulation, deception and knowledge. The results of his plans are only secondary to the delightful joy of entwining mortal fates into one another against their will."
