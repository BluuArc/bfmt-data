It is but a reproduction of a fabled Sphere of legend recreated by a Summoner of the Akras Summoners' Hall. Rumors say that this blade has the ability to manipulate the moisture in the air through the cold it releases, freezing it upon contact. The original blade is believed to have held a much more unbelievable power, though its whereabouts remain unknown."
