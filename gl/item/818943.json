The blade is then enchanted to ensure that it meets as little resistance as possible before tasting its victim's blood. With practice, one can even dispel sorcerous attacks with this weapon, although its properties are better used in Guild Raids. Those who wield this blade are often found on the front lines, eager for the fight ahead of them.",
