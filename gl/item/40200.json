The process was successful, and the resulting stone was more powerful than its original, though the researcher who had created it became mesmerized by it. He didn't regard this experiment he conducted as particularly dangerous, and so he didn't make any details public. Afterwards, the Evil Stone broke into pieces, and its shards are said to have brought continuous calamity about."
