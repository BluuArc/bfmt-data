		"lore": "A pair of old bronze bells Nyami cherishes more than any treasure in the world. These are the only memento she has left of her sister; a gift for her 3rd birthday. On the day her sister was taken away by the slavers, the bells stopped ringing although they weren't damaged. Not even a rattle could be heard. It was as if the bells took a vow of silence, so they would not attract any unwanted attention. Allanon believes that Nyami's bells were imbued with an ancient power borne from her sister's powerful desire to protect her. The bells are not broken and still \"ring\" to this day, toying with the minds of those who harbor any ill intent towards its master."
