	"lore": "This water that seems to continually ooze out of Yugreia's body is speculated to be different from what it seems. It may look like the liquid is dropping from its body, when in fact the liquid is going back into the body as it flows. Similar to how humans breathe in air just after exhaling, it is believed this monster does the same with this liquid. However, since a live specimen can't be brought in for study, there is no way to prove this theory.",
