On the other hand, most commoners believed that the rich came by even more fortune much too easily. Proof of that may lay with this cap, said to effortlessly bring its owner more possessions and money when worn. However, no records are left as to how to obtain it, leaving many to discard it as nothing more than a slacker's fantasy."
