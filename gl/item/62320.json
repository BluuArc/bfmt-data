The Summoners of Old brought it back after a life-threatening mission, revealing nothing about where they obtained it or through what process. Even now, none will speak a word on the issue. Though it has some connection with the end of the world, it is also rumored to be a necessary material for life to advance to a new stage, and the only thing clear at this point in time is its tremendous potential."
