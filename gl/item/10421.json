		"lore": "An extremely rare material found in Ishgria's Lem region. Based on its shape, it is believed to be the claw of some creature, though no further details are known about it. However, light is able to penetrate the claw when it hits it at certain angles, so it is speculated that the creature it belongs to also possesses the ability to make itself transparent. Since this material is light weight but durable, it is highly sought after to make armor."
