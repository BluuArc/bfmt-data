		"lore": "The claw of a bird that inhabits Valdroar. The bird has both feathers and scales, making it appear like a cross between a dragon and bird, and scholars struggled with its classification as a result. In the end it was categorized as a bird because of its bill and fruit-based diet. The bird's fetlocks have sharp claws, tougher even than those of a dragon. Perhaps after further study, we may one day understand why a bird with no natural enemies that does not hunt evolved to possess such claws."
