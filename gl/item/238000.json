Legends tell us that the object of their worship was a rainbow-winged dragon who possessed power greater than a god or a demon. Fearing their expansion, the gods launched an assault against the sect. However, the sect continued to pray to the dragon as long as they could, and their regalia is said to have gained the power to deflect even assaults from the gods."
