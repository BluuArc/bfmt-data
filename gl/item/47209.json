It's said that the Knight's bangle is imbued with divine courage to face the enemies of Lucius, and the Maiden's bangle is imbued with divine purity to convey the will of Lucius. The bracelets are bestowed as a symbol of the Oracle, but some surmise that they may also allow Lucius to monitor those who would faithfully carry out his divine will."
