Construction of such an item requires remains from an enchanted puppet that still hold traces of the Divine Armor's power, making mass production nearly impossible. The Summoners' Hall holds almost all suits of this type of armor currently known to exist, and utilizes them for research into the mysteries of the sealed gods."
