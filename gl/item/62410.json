The robes hold the power to make any who wear them into a divine being, and those with strong spiritual faith are said to gain the same awareness as the gods. In time, the shrine maiden awoke to some unknown truth and departed, never to be seen again. Since that time, a goddess virtually indistinguishable from the shrine maiden's description has appeared to rescue humans from grand disasters.",
