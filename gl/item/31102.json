This shield holds a great amount of power, but, not unlike the goddess's temper, its effective time period is short. Also according to the goddess, if one bearing the shield should perish in battle, they would return once again manifested in pain and agony. One has no choice but to test this theory, as no one knows whether or not the goddess speaks the truth."
