Opportunity bends and coincidence flexes in favor of the user, typically resulting in their flagrant excess despite attempts to unseat them --or worse. Their usefulness eventually comes to an end, however, and they soon themselves sacrificed to advance one of Maestron's many schemes. After all, everything must go according to plan."
