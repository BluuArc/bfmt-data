	"lore": "The bow once used by the gifted Andaria was a difficult and heavy weapon to use. Without a proper bowstring attached to it, the bow instead draws power from its bearer and turns it into a lethal projectile of pure energy. Masters of the weapon like Andaria could fire a variety of projectiles types, from a barrage of bolts to a high-powered shot. Reforged by a mysterious smith, this replica is still a lethal weapon that could effectively convert one’s own spritual energy into devastating bolt of energy.",
