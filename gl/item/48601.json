Its core consists of a foreign substance which was found in the Vortex, and later purified through the dark arts. While conducting an experiment that fooled a certain Summoner with green hair, it was found that this orb had the power to heighten all of its wearer's abilities. The Summoner in question was in terrible shape after suffering from a curse, but the Brass Orb is said to have helped the Summoner recover."
