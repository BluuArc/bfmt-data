Its incredible draw appears to require prodigious strength, but instead relies on the wielder's dexterity and technique rather than brute force. Andaria strongly believed that the end goal of any hunt should be a dance between equals, and not merely that of hunter and hunted.<br><br>Andaria favored swiftness and patience above all, and during the Augmentation Wars, it was said that the last visual registered on many of Gazia's robots was a single, gleaming streak of gold."
