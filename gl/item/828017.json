These special artifacts were personally graced with intricate energy weaves of the Grand Artificer himself and polished to emit a golden hue to represent their superiority. It is our greatest honor and privilege to award this treasure to you who have risen above the fiercest of challenges and earned your right to stand among the most legendary of Heroes."
