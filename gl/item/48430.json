According to the story, this crown is named after the goddess who lived in the Tower of Trials and had given her divine protection to the flower-loving queen of a small country. When the young queen saw the goddess bearing this crown, it is said that the divinity which surrounded her immediately prompted her to pledge her life to the gods."
