		"lore": "The terrifying electrical power that the thunder beast can release originates from an electricity generating organ that runs from its back to its stomach. The electricity is then preserved in special veins that lie underneath the beast's scales. It was discovered in an experiment that even if the organ is destroyed, it takes a number of days to relinquish all of the stored electricity. As for the reason that this beast's tail becomes red hot, it is believed that this occurs due to the tail's high electricity resistance in comparison to the rest of its body."
