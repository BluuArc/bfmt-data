The memories of the real Grahdens, who was able to use his great experience to full effect on the battlefield, are sealed within this crystal. Once purified by Noel from the Summoners' Research Lab and Rhynt from the Imperial Library, the softly glistening light curiously does not fade, remaining visible under any conditions.",
