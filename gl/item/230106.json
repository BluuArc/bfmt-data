The gods attempted to visit numerous punishments upon this tyrant for his loathsome ways, but the tyrant forced his magician to transform the torturer's needle into a decoy. It drew off the gods' curses, leaving him unharmed. The needle gained fearsome power as the gods' wrath passed through it time and again, eventually becoming a weapon so destructive it could threaten the gods themselves."
