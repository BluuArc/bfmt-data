		"lore": "Yugreia is a demon known for possessing the opposing properties of both water and fire. Often resorting to illusions in order to move about, the existence of this jewel was confirmed when Yugreia finally showed its true form. When thrown into a body of water, the jewel is said to turn the liquid into burning flames. When thrown into a fire, the flames turn into flowing water. Many researchers of demonic species hope to make a great break through in their field once they acquire this peculiar stone."
