Often resorting to illusions in order to move about, the existence of this jewel was confirmed when Yugreia finally showed its true form. When thrown into a body of water, the jewel is said to turn the liquid into burning flames. When thrown into a fire, the flames turn into flowing water. Many researchers of demonic species hope to make a great break through in their field once they acquire this peculiar stone.",
