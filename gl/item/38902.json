The pike he brought back with him from his visit there had the power to pierce vital organs as soon as it was drawn, leaving the wounded enemy with many afflictions in the case of having barely survived death. However, Bastia did not have enough power to control the pike, and once he perished and returned to the underworld, it is said that he kept training with his pike for eternity."
