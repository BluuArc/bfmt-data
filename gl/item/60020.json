Believed to have been used in invasions of other nations, the battle plan's contents are flexible for adaptation to enemy formations. As it contains calculations that extend even to the finest of details, it was long thought to have been created by a strategically brilliant soldier. However, research in recent years has revealed that its author was an empress at the time, and that she fought on the front lines against enemy forces."
