The monk is said to have visited extreme environments inaccessible to normal individuals in this quest in order to gather divine energy. Though accounts linger across the land even now, the earliest and latest written accounts span over one thousand years. Some scholars contend that the crystal's power may have extended the monk's life for such a duration."
