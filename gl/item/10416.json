This beast resembles the Cerberus that roam the Mistral region, but it is infinitely bigger and more ferocious, making it a much more dangerous opponent. Many believe the Cerberus of Mistral to be the less capable descendant of this ancient beast, having adapted to survive in that particular environment."
