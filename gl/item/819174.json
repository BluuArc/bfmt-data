Facing obliteration, the demon pleaded with Hadaron for a lighter judgement. Hadaron sealed the demon into his greataxe, where it would serve Athensphere for all time. Under its master's watchful eye, the demon unleashes itself in battle to consume the souls of his foes. These souls are trapped in Kronax alongside the demon, to be called upon in the defense of Athensphere. It is rumored among the demigods that anybody too weak to wield Kronax risks being devoured by the demon.",
