On discovering radioactive materials produced with otherworldly technologies while investigating its interior, Noel transferred the material to a unique catalyst. He then detected high levels of life energy from it, and proceeded to modify the device into a Sphere. It has manifested self-repairing functions, and Noel continues to mutter about room for further study."
