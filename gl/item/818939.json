It increases the user's physical strength by purifying their life force and filling it with courage. The words \"The Dust-Yellow King shall triumph no more.\" can be found along its rim. It empowers its user in Guild Raids, although some have claimed to dream afterward of battles against a warrior clothed in gold."
