		"lore": "An enchanted shield that belonged to the first Deva Champion who dealt a crushing defeat to the first invading Morokai horde.  This legendary artifact has since been passed down from one Champion to another. Even after five hundred years of war, the shield still retains its luster and bears not a single scratch nor dent on it. The technique used to forge the shield was lost to the flames of war when one of their grand forges was razed to the ground. After being named Champion by the Emperor himself, Mikael became the shield's next bearer. Ironically, it had previously been wielded by his beloved brother, a disgraced Champion and branded traitor suspected of fleeing the battlefield. "
