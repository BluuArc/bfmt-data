This combination of living creature and biological device attaches itself to the user's chest and grants them an increase in strength, agility, and power--for a price. As long as the wearer enjoys Malachus's patronage, no ill effects will be noticed. Indeed, it will take an extended period of time away from her side before one is beset by wracking hungers and unnamable illnesses. As one sickens and finds life's pleasures turning into ash in their mouths, this thing detaches from their body and wriggles home. They soon perish thereafter."
