During their final battle, each of the five warriors' attacks exhibited a light of different color that combined with the rest, leaving behind a single locus of five different hues. The origins of a painting depicting this locus made of colors that refused to merge together is unknown, but it is said that to this day whoever looks upon it is filled with courage."
