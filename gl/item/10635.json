		"lore": "A mysterious precious stone rarely found in Valdroar. If you look inside the transparent sphere, the fluttering light resembles a dragon that spreads its wings and flies through the sky. As for its real nature, there are many theories. Some surmise that the eyes of ancient dragons formed into the jewels, while others believe that excess magical power inside a dragon's body crystallized to form them. But all that is nothing more than conjecture, and there is still much need for further research and investigation."
