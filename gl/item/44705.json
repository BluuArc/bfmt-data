	"lore": "This Sphere was created by Noel of the Akras Summoners' Research Lab. Its primary function is to maintain the magical and mental power of the one who equips it, and thus contains a mechanism that allows it to encircle the wearer in a magic-enhancing barrier. Due its ability to redirect the excess power emitted when the barrier is expanded even further, this device can hugely increase the user's fundamental abilities.",
