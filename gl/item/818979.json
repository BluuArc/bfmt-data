This inhuman thing attaches itself to the user's chest, allowing them at their peak to defy immortal-crushing odds. As long as the wearer enjoys Malachus's patronage, no ill effects will be noticed. However, some have noticed that users become reckless warriors, eager to fight at the smallest provocation. Their belligerence tends to get them killed, which is not an easy feat when one's flesh eagerly accepts pain in every shape and form. \"Let me have you, and we shall explore the sweet promise of power together--forever. Mine.\""
