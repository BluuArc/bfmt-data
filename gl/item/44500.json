This piece of equipment can foresee when it is about to take damage, and thus can also occasionally decrease the impact the wearer receives. Also, since it becomes very solid and heavy as it guards against attacks, this sensation makes the wearer feel more secure, heightening their mental stability as well. The creator of this piece is unknown, but since nothing else like it is known to exist in Grand Gaia, it is speculated that it may be a product from another world.",
