The beast's pelt is covered with bristly hairs that provide excellent protection, but with improvisation by the best armor craftsmen in the Agni Empire, they've been transformed into beautiful yet functional armor of the highest quality. It's said that rulers of other countries have offered exorbitant amounts of gold in exchange for armor made from these pelts.",
