There had been rumors that the hide had come from an illusive creature of old that had the ability to vanish in an instant, rendering only the most skilled ancient hunters able to kill one. Some say it had been some sort of horse, but no one has been able to identify it. Once killed, its body incinerates to ashes leaving behind only its shiny hide.",
