		"lore": "As corruption and hedonism rose within the kingdom, Malachus stepped up her efforts to occupy the defenders and divert their attention. Poisoned foodstuffs made the peasantry suddenly fertile beyond belief, and many families soon had several extra mouths to feed - a disaster in the wake of the famine that had plagued the land. Those whose bodies were already weakened by endless celebrations found themselves succumbing to disease, leaving their weak-willed successors foundering in the chaos. Her view of her rivals was thus: \"For all his plans, Maestron has proven to be utterly predictable in his schemes. As for his pawns, they are too easily bought off with a breathy promise - weak worms.\""
