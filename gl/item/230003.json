Thereafter the king sent his men to every region in the land to investigate this phenomenon. They found what was apparently a fraction of one of the fallen stars, and its composition and shape were made of minerals unknown to the region. Believing it to be a gift from the gods, the king placed the stone upon his crown, and established a peaceful reign that would last for over 18 generations.",
