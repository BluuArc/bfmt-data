It was kept there on the pretense of allowing the king to freely strike down any pandering, disloyal subjects, but the axe was only used once. Furthermore, in that instance it was used by an antihero to slay a foolish king. Afterwards, the axe was stored in a temple as a symbol of the destruction borne of the corrupt and deceitful."
