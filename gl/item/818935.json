To assist them in maintain their libraries, they utilize magical staffs as instruments to move massive shelves from one place to another, or sieve through mountains of scrolls that need sorting. Due to the predicament Allanon brought upon himself, his trusty staff has been customized to be more suited for combat. However, since it uses a mishmash of untested crystals from Myrranthia and Baldemar, Allanon's staff is capable of delivering some rather...unpredictable results. Please use with caution."
