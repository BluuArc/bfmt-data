The first god died from the shot of a single arrow, while the second was more nimble and took two arrows instead. The third god braved through the bow's miasma and counterattacked, but the momentum the arrow had picked up proved to be too much to withstand in the end. This story was believed to be pure myth, but there are too many coincidences with ancient tales of an evil presence that slayed countless gods."
