Its existence alone became a threat to the harmonious balance of the world, and thus the gods ordered a sorcerer to destroy it. However, this sorcerer became bewitched by the bow's power, and escaped with it elsewhere. Now, in a place no one suspects, the bow's grudge grows deeper as it feeds upon its owner."
