	"lore": "A fang continuously surrounded by a bit of electricity. The fang was believed to belong to a creature that resembles a giraffe in its mature state, but since the beast has lower intelligence than a giraffe and its stature is also smaller, this claim is disputed by many scholars. This beast's fang has the ability to absorb electricity, so it is often used as a material to create weapons. However, since it also has the power to call lightning, its magical properties are used for various rituals, and to set up traps as well.",
