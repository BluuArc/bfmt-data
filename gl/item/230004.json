The tears formed beautiful jewels when they dried, and touching them was believed to bestow blessings of long life as well as spiritual and mental healing. The people began to pray to them. Afterwards, the temple's cleric died by mysterious causes, and the statue began to weep tears of blood once again. All at once, the people of the area began to fear the statue, and sealed it deep beneath the earth along with its jewels."
