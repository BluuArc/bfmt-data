The queen perished from anxiety and grief, while her daughter was forced to live a harsh life in a village nearby, growing stronger through hard labor. This daughter who loved flowers, and whom was loved by them as well, would end up pledging her life to the gods. Once her new self was born, she returned to the battlefield in the country that had exiled her, making flowers of fresh blood bloom in her path."
