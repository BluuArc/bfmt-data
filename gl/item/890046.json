		"lore": "Remnants of spent arcane energy. Glows faintly in the dark and emits a tingling aura. Grain-like and glittering, these are often mistaken for tiny crystals.<br><br>Practitioners of heka are familiar with these grains. When arcane energy manifests physically, it leaves an 'imprint' upon the fabric of the world, such as smoke trails or motes of light. Upon contact with an object, the energy usually scatters as a burst, leaving trace amounts of these grains. It is not uncommon for spell-slinging grounds to be littered with arcane remnants, giving their floors a distinctive blue tinge."
