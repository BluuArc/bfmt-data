Holding the Yata no Kagami up high, it exposed and branded creatures of chaos that were masquerading as gods and causing havoc, causing them to vanish from Grand Gaia. Its great light lured out primal gods who then shaped the known world. This legend is based on a story from another world, however, and its degree of authenticity remains unknown.",
