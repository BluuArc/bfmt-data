This festival, which originated with the intentions of praying for sound health by letting dolls made of flowers float down the river, is now said to take place in exchange for the statue of this goddess. The statue, bigger than a babe, abates the spiritual burdens of whomever possesses it. One has to wonder if the love of the goddess also makes her shoulder the pains of the flower dolls as well."
