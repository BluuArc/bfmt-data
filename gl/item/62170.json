		"lore": "A shield called the ultimate defense by a warrior renowned as \"Scar the Unyielding.\" It grants its wielder \"the blessing of the struggle.\" This effect slowly hardens the bearer's skin in response to injuries, eventually reaching a hardness that surpasses even diamonds. This power only manifests during extremely trying situations, although that may be a deliberate feature. Its creator, Paradoxia, was known for only granting weaponry to those destined to endure great trials."
