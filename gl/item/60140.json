It does not seem suited for use as a weapon, but previous wielders spoke of feeling a sense of being protected by some sort of presence. One theory holds that it was crafted by a goddess in another world out of concern for a hero's safety. However, the truth of the matter is unclear, as is the source of this explanation.",
