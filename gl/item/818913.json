		"lore": "Using techniques developed by the Master Smiths of Athensphere, an incredibly dense ore of unkown origins was forged into a massive warhammer. The process was said to have been so intense that the Scared Forge was left in a state beyond repair, thus its name Forgebreaker. Forgebreaker was gifted to Deimos by Zedus, inrecognition of his unrivalled strength and pledge of loyalty. Every blow from Forgehammer sounded like a massive clap of thunder, shattering the ground in its immediate vicinity. It is rumored that the ore was obtained from the Void itself and within it houses an unimmaginable amount of raw energy. The mysterious energy from the warhammer is believed to grant its bearer extraordinary stamina, allowing Deimos to fight for days on end. "
