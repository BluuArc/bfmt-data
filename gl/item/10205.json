		"lore": "This nut is from the broad-leaved Bara tree. It can heal temporary paralysis, but its hard to eat as is because of how spicy it is. Due to this, however, its powdered form is extremely popular among spice lovers. It can be found wild in many areas around the Mistral region, such as the Remains of Mirza."
