Even though it is an imitation, it has the power to raise one's basic abilities to a superhuman level, as if to show the great difference between gods and humans. Furthermore, various forms of protection are activated depending on the circumstances, as if to reflect the spirit of the two different gods, who were trusted more deeply than the Holy Emperor himself. Many believe this grants the ornament power to guide the wearer straight to victory.",
