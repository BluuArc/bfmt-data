Apparently, they contain the power to awaken the magical energies that lie dormant in broken magical puppets, and also the power to merge the energies of multiple puppets. However, as reports also state that anyone in possession of such a crystal will become a target for the puppets, the Summoners' Hall currently manages all collection of and research into these crystals."
