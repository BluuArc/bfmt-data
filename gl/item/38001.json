An item capable of sinking the world into chaos, most Demon Shards were destroyed, except for these clones that survived in safekeeping. Years later the existence of these stones became known to a large number of raiders and adventurers, who immediately sought after them. However, many of them were victims of very strange accidents while looking for the stones, which drove them to give up their search."
