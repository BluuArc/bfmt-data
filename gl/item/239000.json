It was made to slay a demon that cloaked itself in shadowy defenses and held unmatched power, and the smith entrusted it to a swordmaster upon completion. The demon sneered on seeing the blade, saying that its light would only shine for an instant. However, the tales tell us that the swordmaster cleaved through the demon's defenses and sliced it in two in the instant before the blade's light dissipated.",
