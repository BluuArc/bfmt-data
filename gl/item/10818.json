	"id": 10818,
	"lore": "This peculiar bone, which was found in the body of Van Nader, seems to be apt for many different types of uses, and thus is gathering lots of attention. The Summoner that collected this item brought it back for analysis and put it through a grinder. To his surprise, the blades on the grinder had broken trying to destroy the bone. Researchers believe that this tough metal could be used to create new tools, but they have been unsuccessful in doing so thus far.",
