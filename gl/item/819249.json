Unlike some, Inoko had no qualms defending her pride with the ire of her true self. The great curved tusks atop her perfect coiffure were a symbol of that fierce nature.<br><br>It's generally a bad idea to get into a shouting match with this beastly beauty, but her friends maintain she is, at her heart, fiercely sincere."
