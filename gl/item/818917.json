		"lore": "Aurelia's Harp was a beautiful work of art imbued with a mysterious power. The harp was said to behave in many different ways, depending on the intentions of its master. In the hands of the affectionate Aurelia, she used the harp's power to heal the sick and reinvigorate the despondent. When malice gripped Aurelia's heart, its tunes could perform the exact opposite of its original task. While not as potent as the original harp might have been, this replica greatly boosts it's bearer's vitality and latent spiritual powers."
