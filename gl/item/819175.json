	"lore": "Blades of exquisite craftsmanship that glow with moonlight, the Vesper Argentum was said to be the very same wielded by the First-Who-Walkedâ€”the first vampire. Gabriela Ninlil, matriarch of the Black Dragon coven, bequeathed these blades to Kielazar to protect them from the vampire courts that longed to recover them from her guardianship. Legends say that the Vesper Argentum reflects its owner's soul. In Kielazar's possession, the argent surface ripples with ghostly energy, and howls through the air when swung. Perhaps the spirit of Kielazar's loyal wolfhound companion, Mannag, is indelibly tied to his.",
