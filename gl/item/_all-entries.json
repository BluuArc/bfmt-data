Research has also revealed that the chemical is addictive, leading to high-value trading in the fruit among profiteering merchants."

However, the reason why this pearl-like jewel glows itself is still unknown, and its high value as a material makes research difficult."

Unfortunately, however, the Phoenix was unable to return to its home without the ability to fly, forcing it to live in solitude in the demon's world until nothing but its vibrantly colored bones were left."

Legends say that the Vesper Argentum reflects its owner's soul. In Kielazar's possession, the argent surface ripples with ghostly energy, and howls through the air when swung. Perhaps the spirit of Kielazar's loyal wolfhound companion, Mannag, is indelibly tied to his."
