Noel has added a battery meter to inform the bearer when it is time to charge the armor.<br><br>In addition to maintaining a solid defense, the shield is now able to power up the wearer's strength and stamina. Some describe the experience as a powerful force of nature.<br><br>Its rudimentary sentience occasionally manifests as a soft whisper coming from the shield itself: \"I have root!\" Interpretations of this simple sentence vary, but the most popular and accepted one is that the armor as declared its host as part of itselfâ€”the source of its energy and something to protect."
