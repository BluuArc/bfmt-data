Over many generations it would be rediscovered, and renamed after where it was found. While its original title and author are unknown, it is said to contain knowledge cultivated over long years of war. Believed to have been treasured and kept close by its owners, only a scarce few copies were ever made. Accordingly, only this one copy is known to have survived to the present day.",
