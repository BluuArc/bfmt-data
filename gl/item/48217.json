Due to the poor response of ancient materials, its performance was questioned initially. However, the completed Sphere demonstrated impressive powers. These powers included avoidance of danger via precognition, and the ability to convert its wielder's fear into strength. It is said that Noel muttered, \"it's impressive for something still being researched,\" upon seeing its abilities."
