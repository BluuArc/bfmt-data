In some faraway lands, this trinket is said to bestow blessings upon the recipient, and is often received from a monk or priest in the temple.<br><br>The demand of this item is so high in some areas that the temples are unwilling to distribute more than they claim their gods can provide. In dark alleys and lonely street corners, though, the truly desperate might come across a handful of these for sale for a good amount of coin from foxish individuals."
