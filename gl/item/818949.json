With additional bio-mechanical material worked into its form and its own muscular electric capacitor discharging secondary currents to maximize its strength and speed, it is considered one of the most effective weapons of death and life on the battlefield. As some have remarked, it is a thing of horrifying beauty, perfectly mirroring its namesake's nature, especially in Guild Raids."
