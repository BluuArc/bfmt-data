Despite the initial findings, some researchers in the Summoners' Hall continued to examine this \"useless\" trinket for any sort of secret it might have. During one such scientific jaunt, a certain child prodigy and his assistant found—quite by accident—that while the relic does little for its user, all allies near them report an increase in prowess. With this new breakthrough, the Summoners' Hall decided to allow this relic to be brought into the field in order to better understand its effects upon the user's allies."
