		"lore": "A brightly polished helmet with a protective visor owned by the exuberant craftsman Peter. Even in human form, the celestial rabbit boasted an agility like no other, being able to lend his fellow animals a helping hand on top of his own tasks.<br><br>Part of Peter's work ethic is to always prepare as many solutions as possible to any problems that may arise. Unfortunately, this also means a complete lack of planning or foresight, and the sheer amount of roundabout repair work is in itself a hazard. Little wonder his colleagues refer to his helmet as a brain-bucket."
