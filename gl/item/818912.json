		"lore": "After upgrading her cannon, Bonnie left behind a strange mechanical contraption before bounding off into the woods. The engineers from the Imperial Capital Randall began studying the gadget, hoping to create an alloy which was just as strong as the metal in which Bonnie's cannon was made of. Their experiment was fraught with many perils. Their metallic apparatuses would be magentized at random intervals and sent flying all over the research chamber. Engineers who made physical contact with the strange gadget without proper protection would soon succumb to a unknown illness (thankfully they all victims to the disease recovered after a few days rest). While the brave engineers could not create a similar alloy, they did manage to replicate and apply the mysterious properties of Bonnie's cannon's mysterious mechanical thingy onto regular metals. These treated metals were used as weapon enchancers, mysteriously reducing the weight of it's metallic host and emitting a mild electrical charge that severly weakens any living thing it strikes."
