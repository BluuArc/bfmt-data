Engineers from Randall began studying the gadget, hoping to create an alloy of unprecedented strength. Their experiments were fraught with many perils. While they failed to achieve their goal, they did manage to replicate and apply some mysterious properties to an extent. The results were the weapon enhancers that could manipulate weight and strike any target with a mild, weakening electrical charge."
