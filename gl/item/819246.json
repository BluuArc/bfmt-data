Every individual possesses one from birth, and this protective force stays with them for life.<br><br>Rarely, a sülde can manifest physically when an object or idol is consecrated to it. Jeweled beads are favored by Southern folk for their versatility as worn jewelry and as a convenient home should the sülde choose to make its presence known."
