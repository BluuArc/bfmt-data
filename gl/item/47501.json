According to legend, all enemies cut down by this sword would be robbed of their souls, screaming in a most inhuman voice as life left their bodies. Though the existence of a curse cannot be confirmed, those swordsmen who have wielded this katana at least once will attest to the notion that it moved on its own accord whilst in their hands, leading them towards the enemies which had the weakest defense on the battlefield. At any rate, there is no doubt that this blade hides within it a terrible power. ",
