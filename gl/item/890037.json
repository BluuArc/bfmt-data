		"lore": "With its rich, royal blue, plumes of this quality were often emblematic of particularly old and established noble arcanist houses. Variously used as quills, decoration, and accessories, most members of the family carried one on their person. To receive one through courier was, at best, a one-off threat—and at worst, a sign from the Mageslayer that their entire house was next.<br><br>Vrána's house was certainly prestigious enough to warrant these tokens of status, but the young heiress now sees them as a running tally of her targets."
