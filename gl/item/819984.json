As the city burned to the ground, Malachus ordered her troops to taunt the agents of the Inquisition, slowing their return to the city as they harassed their rear guard and poisoned their minds long after the siege. Her view of her rivals was thus: \"For all his plans, Maestron has proven to be utterly predictable in his schemes. As for his pawns, they are too easily bought off with a breathy promise - weak worms.\"",
