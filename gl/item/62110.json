Afterwards, when the group faced a perilous situation as they found themselves surrounded by the God Army once again, they raised the magical mirror towards the heavens to create a barrier of light around them. The barrier reflected every attack it received, sending the God Army into a frenzy, and ultimately repelling the advance."
