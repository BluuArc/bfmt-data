		"lore": "The power that the Blight grants to those who gain his favor may seem unremarkable until it blooms in times of need. Shifting in pattern and hue, the user sees the actions that link cause and effect together. Soon, they become capable of making reality-bending strikes that turn illnesses into flowers or a crowd's hunger into flocks of geese. Their accomplishments become legend, even as their bodies start to slowly fail. One day, they simply implode as Malekhan's spores dig deeply into the ground they occupied a few moments before. Just as intended."
