It is believed to grant its wielder immense destructive power, but it is also said that this ultimately dooms long-term wielders to experience the emptiness and futility of battle. Because of this, it came to be seen as a forbidden weapon by the battle-loving demons of Ishgria, and few would handle it despite its incredible power."
