When the fairy tribe's forest was invaded by the God Army, a certain knight used this shield to protect the forest, giving the fairy tribe more time to escape. Undaunted by any attack, the knight ultimately perished with the shield still in his hand. The general of the God Army witnessed this, and even though the knight was an enemy, ensured he was buried respectfully along with the shield."
