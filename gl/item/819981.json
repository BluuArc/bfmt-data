		"lore": "As corruption and hedonism rose within the kingdom, Malachus's armies finally arose from tainted groves and desecrated halls. They swarmed over the weakened defenders, demons barely pausing to eat the weakened ones before moving on to their next targets. As the city burned to the ground, Malachus ordered her troops to taunt the agents of the Inquisition, slowing their return to the city as they harassed their rear guard and poisoned their minds long after the siege. Her view of her rivals was thus: \"So pathetically boring. Malekhan likes to count his victories before they even come to pass - which makes his disappointment that much sweeter.\""
