There was once a man who committed an unavoidable sin he regretted, so he asked the gods to forgive him. And though he continued to pray, he could not erase the sin he had committed in the past. No matter how much he regretted what he had done, the past could not be changed. However, one god decided to answer the man's prayer. Legend has it that this god used its powerful fist to destroy the karma connected to the man's sin, freeing him from it."
