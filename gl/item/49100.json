When a great fire ravaged the Principality, the flames devoured the woods nearby, and it was thought that they would all be reduced to ashes. However, when the flames reached a certain location, it is said that they were all snuffed out in an instant. Afterwards, the location was deemed sacred and access to it was restricted. But rumors also exist claiming that a lost young girl saw a divine bow when she ventured there unknowingly.",
