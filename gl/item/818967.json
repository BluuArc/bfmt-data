This belies its true ability: a danger-free life with a godlike ability to sense both danger and opportunity in every shape and form. Opportunity bends and coincidence flexes in their favor, causing them to become famous overnight as many turn to them for answers. Their usefulness eventually comes to an end, however, and they soon themselves sacrificed to advance one of Maestron's many schemes. After all, everything must go according to plan."
