Malekhan contributed much to the events leading up to the invasion, starting with a blight spread by his cultists that caused crops to fail and animals to slowly sicken. As death and starvation began to spread throughout the land, the Raug overlords began the next stage of their plans. Master of decay, disease and enfeeblement, Malekhan was the oldest Raug overlord. Patient beyond human comprehension, no one was safe from his influence."
