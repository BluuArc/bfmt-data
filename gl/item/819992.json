	"lore": "A legendary aegis used by an ancient king centuries before the great war broke out. Few records of said king survived the trials of time, thus little is known about him, but it is said that he wore this aegis even in his sleep. He lived to be 326 years old. Some believe that the aegis held the power of immortality, and that he only died because the aegis was taken from him, though there hasn't been concrete evidence to prove this.",
