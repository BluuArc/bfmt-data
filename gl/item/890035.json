Peering closely, it seems to resemble the white robes of a warrior monk.<br>Its jagged edges suggest it was torn off in a hurry, perhaps in response to fire of some kind. It is notably missing the sort of smoky smell you'd expect it to have, though.<br><br>Tales of monks and priests from that faraway land speak of their unique ability to channel divine energy into a searing light, causing deceitful creatures of evil to burst into holy flame upon contact."
