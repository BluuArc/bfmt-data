Much too hot to handle without safety precautions, but contains a substantial amount of energy that makes it a valuable material in crafting.<br><br>Research suggests that these crystals are formed when energy solidifies within the core of a Revenant. The raging flames of a Fire Revenant dance within its glossy surface, as if it had captured a sliver of fiery hell within its spherical form."
