It is said that not only does the charm protect its owner from calamities and awards him or her good fortune, but it offers the same protection to said owner's descendants. Forged by the gods themselves, this charm is rumored to have originally been in the custody of a certain shrine. How it eventually ended up in the hands of Grand Gaians, however, remains a mystery."
