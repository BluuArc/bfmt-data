Crafted from a variety of substances, it can unerringly strike at the material desired by its wielder regardless of angle or direction. Some of those who wield it for combat find its length a handy container for a variety of poisons and elemental powders - all the best for inflicting an excruciating death, especially in Guild Raids."
