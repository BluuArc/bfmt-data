Being the organ that acts both as the life source and the power regulator for the multi-powered Arkem, it is said that if it were to suffer even the most minor amount of damage, it would render Arkem unable to control its powers and cause it to disintegrate on the spot. Needless to say, this core is extremely difficult to obtain, but any demon weapon or regular weapon fashioned from it holds an incredible amount of power.",
