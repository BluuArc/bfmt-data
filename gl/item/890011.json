Contains a substantial amount of energy that makes it a valuable material in crafting.<br><br>Research suggests that these crystals are formed when energy solidifies within the core of a Revenant. Light has always been associated with life, and it is little wonder its associated Revenant constantly seeks the embrace of the first sunrise."
