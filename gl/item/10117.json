The rarely-spotted Grylus inhabits ruins, and is therefore known as the \"Gray Phantom.\" It's been found that the bird is aligned with both Light and Dark Elements, an unusual quality thought to be caused by Menon's peculiar environment; the land where Karna Masta was sealed, which is home to the resting bodies of countless demons."
