It is but a reproduction of a fabled Sphere of legend recreated by a Summoner of the Akras Summoners' Hall. Rumors say that the lance came into Claire's younger brother Colt's possession after she fell in battle. Possessing immense power, all research concerning this Sphere came to a halt when the summoned Claire's hidden abilities were successfully unlocked."
