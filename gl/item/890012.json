		"lore": "A large crystal occasionally left behind by a Dark Revenant. Dark, yet mesmerising, it seems to grow brighter as dusk approaches. Contains a substantial amount of energy that makes it a valuable material in crafting.<br><br>Research suggests that these crystals are formed when energy solidifies within the core of a Revenant. Darkness has always been associated with death and fear, as it is in the war-torn plane of Orebus, but it is not taboo to some cultures. Death, after all, is but the next stage of life."
