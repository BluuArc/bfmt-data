		"lore": "Named after the Vardket deity of weapons and fortune, this blade was reforged once again through magical means. The words beaten into the wyrmscale folded and mingled with the blackest poisons of the Vardket used to enhance this blade cause memories of its wielder's triumphs to spring back to life. The weapon itself seems to swallow light, and the strength it grants once it draws blood turns mortals into monsters. Its bearers are often eager for fighting, especially when in Guild Raids. Unfortunately for this blade's victims, however, protective walls and barriers only serve to delay their inevitable fate."
