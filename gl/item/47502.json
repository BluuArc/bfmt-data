Not only does it possess the ability to guard its master against all sorts of calamities, but the bright light released from its sharpened tip can also reduce any enemies it strikes to shreds. Its magical powers feed off the willpower of its wielder, an ability that according to otherworldly myth rendered a particular warrior able to perform miracles. This legendary weapon has also been recognized for its great beauty, though acquiring it can prove to be an arduous task."
