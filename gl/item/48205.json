	"lore": "There was once a flying dragon named Kiravell which lived near the Sama Kingdom. At the time, a rumor claiming that bathing in dragon's blood would make one immortal spread like wildfire, and thus many warriors attempted to take Kiravell's life. However, none of them survived the wrath of the dragon's Thunder Pearl, which tore them all to pieces. When the leader of the Sama Dragoons heard of Kiravell's fury, he went to see the dragon in order to appease it, eventually gaining Kiravell's Thunder Pearl itself as a symbol of their mutual trust.",
