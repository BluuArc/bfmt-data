		"lore": "The Meru-Meru fairy tree is a fearsome creature, but it is also undoubtedly a plant. The proof of this is in its thick foliage, the flowers that bloom from it, and the large fruit that it bears. When covered by the unusual hardness of this nut's shell, it doesn't have the usual poisonous or medical effect one would expect. For this reason, the pit of the nut is discarded, and many craftsmen place emphasis on the many beneficial uses of its hard shell instead."
