		"lore": "A rare fossilized flower named for the dark phoenix said to fly through the underworld in the legends of the Agni Empire. Rumors held that those who found this flower would enjoy the phoenix's protection, keeping death at bay. This ignited a rampant harvesting of the flowers, which led them to the brink of extinction. However, an inspection of the fossils that have been discovered revealed that these are not flowers, but rather a the feathers of a bird. Some scholars seem to take this as proof of the existence of phoenixes."
