Contains a substantial amount of energy that makes it a valuable material in crafting.<br><br>Research suggests that these crystals are formed when energy solidifies within the core of a Revenant. Its smooth surface is misted over from the ice within. Might this be the frozen heart of a Revenant, if they truly possess souls?"
