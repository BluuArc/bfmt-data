This allows the wearer to fight better in battle, especially in Guild Raids. The scroll at the phylactery's center shines with a soft light once its owner is on the field, which makes it visible through the wyrmscale encasing it. Some wearers claim to see a warrior clothed in gold at the edge of their dreams from time to time, which mysteriously leaves them with a sensation of dryness in their mouth and eyes."
