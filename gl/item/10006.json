The sharp fangs at the corolla of this terrifying plant have devoured many a man, but the core within it is more difficult to acquire still. Being the organ that collects all of the Queen Sipla's necessary nutrients, its value is quite high and is often used to concoct secret medicinal formulas, as well as strengthening weapons and armor."
