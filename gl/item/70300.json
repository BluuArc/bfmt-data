This incense stabilizes the spirit, and has the ability to cure any wounds that the soul itself may have suffered. It has the power to heal Demon Slayers for a short time, but it takes a lot of preparation to burn, and thus an exclusive burner is required. However, any error committed when processing this incense can result in dangerous ingredients, and thus it is not available for common use.",
