Resolving to resist this fate, their young leader donned their traditional red garb and made his way to the battlefield. Inspired by the young leader's courage, a miraculous victory was seized from the jaws of defeat. Their legends tell us that they abandoned prophecy from that point onward, choosing instead to forge their own fates.",
