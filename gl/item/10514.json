It was thought to be a mythical creature at first, but after the fangs of a creature not found anywhere in the area were discovered, many began to believe that the fangs belonged to the rumored invisible beast. Once it was discovered that these fangs had great beneficial properties, the search for the invisible creature heightened, though such creature has yet to be found."
