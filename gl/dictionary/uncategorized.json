Dreaming of becoming an expert markswoman, she trained every day by taking down targets she had set throughout the forest. She learned to use her innate speed to take out several targets at once, a skill that became extremely useful whilst on the actual battlefield. Little by little people began to fear the power of her roaring cannon, as well as that of her cunning, but most of her opponents still refused to give her any credit as a warrior.

Though her cannon had grown bigger in size and grew heavier with each upgrade, Bonnie's extraordinary agility still allowed her to move about the battlefield with great ease.

Sensing a strange power emanating from them, she began checking every nook and cranny of all the regions she visited hoping to find more of these mystical eggs to collect for her precious basket. However, she started to notice that the enemy encounters during her hunt kept increasing, and thus decided to train herself, as well as Bianco, to fight off the dangers of the land.

Bianco had changed as well, having grown even larger in size and donning beautifully gilded armor. This unexpected power she had gained turned her into a palpable presence on the battlefield, allowing her to intimidate her foes with her aura alone before taking them down. Now certain of the power hidden within these colorful eggs, she decided to hunt for more of them to bring back to Paskua, where she could share them with her people.
