		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10063_DESCRIPTION": "If you look closely, you can see signs of ancient battles having taken place here. You start to wonder what the exiled disciples' battles were like.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10064_DESCRIPTION": "From an opening in the trees you can see an enormous building in the distance. Is this the Soaring Tree Tower Shusui spoke of? You're almost there.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_100703_DESCRIPTION": "A celebrated traveler who is almost unmatched in her swordsmanship. Her skills had brought her to be able to match herself to fight against the gods' invasion.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10070_DESCRIPTION": "The gigantic tower might as well be a skyscraper piercing the sea of clouds. Could its candle-like branches be the stronghold of a demon?",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10073_DESCRIPTION": "No matter how you think of it, what Shusui says makes little sense. Why is he testing you? You can't read the demon's mind at all.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10074_DESCRIPTION": "You can feel a great power ahead, but it doesn't belong to a demon. Could it be Shusui's last trial? Better prepare yourself before proceeding.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_100803_DESCRIPTION": "A man whose soul that is one with the darkness and mastered total discipline within. To see a red glow in the shadows would deem one's certain death.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10101_DESCRIPTION": "If you don't watch your step, you may end up stepping in the hot lava. Sticking your foot in there does not look like a good idea.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10110_DESCRIPTION": "The goddess Mora suddenly appears before you. When she mentions she once served Lord Lucius, you can't help but to remember Tilith.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10111_DESCRIPTION": "You've seen many a spectacular scenery in Ishgria, so now that you're at the Wetlands, you can truly appreciate their bizarre beauty.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10112_DESCRIPTION": "You feel anxious knowing a presence near you holds terrible power. The humidity of the wetlands clings to your skin, making you really uncomfortable.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10113_DESCRIPTION": "Mora guides you through the Wetlands. Since it's Seria and Lugina, you know they are safe, but you can't help to worry a little.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10114_DESCRIPTION": "There's a faint aroma of sea breeze in the moist air.  This change can only mean that the end of the Wetlands is near.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10120_DESCRIPTION": "The power of a person similar to Karl has been awakened? What could it mean? You hope Karl is safe as you wonder what this is all about.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10121_DESCRIPTION": "Paris warns that the thick and overgrown plants here are different from the ones in Grand Gaia. Some of them may be poisonous, so be careful.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10122_DESCRIPTION": "Another bad feeling. That's the third time since you arrived to Lem. Without a doubt, an enemy with great power approaches. Brace yourself.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10123_DESCRIPTION": "Pushing your way through an animal trail, you reach a small thicket. Hearing a rustle coming from the bushes, you ready yourself. It was an animal.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10124_DESCRIPTION": "The giant trees have cleared out. Now you can probably make it out of the forest quicker. The possibilities of encountering enemies are high though.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1012_DESCRIPTION": "Just as with Karl, you have faith that Grahdens is safe. But your loss of words to console Karl is regrettable.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101300_DESCRIPTION": "Is Nekki an alien from outer space??",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10131_DESCRIPTION": "Your body goes slightly numb after approaching an electrified crystal. Best be careful of your surroundings and keep some distance from the crystals.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10132_DESCRIPTION": "You feel something ominous. A frightfully strong enemy is bound to show itself at any minute, but there seems to be no way to escape.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10133_DESCRIPTION": "You climb over the great ancient dragon's claws. You don't want to fight an opponent this gigantic, but you may have to in the future...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10134_DESCRIPTION": "The small electrified crystals have gotten much bigger, and the dragon's bones are almost invisible now. The Ruins can't be far from here.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1013_DESCRIPTION": "You sense a sudden drop in temperature around you. Judging from experience, this means danger is not far off.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101400_DESCRIPTION": "Celebrate the New Year in this special once a day dungeon! We hope you enjoy all we have in store this year for Brave Frontier!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10140_DESCRIPTION": "You're surprised by Paris's course of action. You had vaguely noticed a change, but now it's clear that this Paris is more free spirited than before.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10141_DESCRIPTION": "You head towards the Ruins in search of Seria and Lugina. Now that Paris is not around, walking behind the silent Mora doesn't feel right.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10142_DESCRIPTION": "A bad feeling overcomes you. A sharp, blood thirsty will made of pure evil draws near. There's nowhere to run, so prepare a good counterattack.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10143_DESCRIPTION": "Just how far did Paris go? You can't pick up any presences around you, but whatever you encounter will not be weak. It would be good to regroup.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10144_DESCRIPTION": "Things are happening so suddenly, there is no time to react. What could Mora be thinking? There's no time to ponder about that either.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1014_DESCRIPTION": "A wielder of ice magic carrying a terrifying axe stands in your way. A fierce battle is about to start, but make it quick. The snowfield's exit is near.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101500_DESCRIPTION": "Celebrate the New Year in this special once a day dungeon! We hope you enjoy all we have in store this year for Brave Frontier!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10150_DESCRIPTION": "After being apart for such a long time, you reunite with Seria and Lugina. Now you must begin all preparations necessary to face Mora once again.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10151_DESCRIPTION": "The black rocks and red lava remind you of the first caverns you passed through. It's not that hot here, but you're thrown off by the ominous miasma.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10152_DESCRIPTION": "A bad feeling once again. You've felt this countless times by now, this evil intent to kill. And combined with the miasma, chills run down your spine.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10153_DESCRIPTION": "When you look behind you, it seems as if all the land were illuminated by lightning. Perhaps it's the dragon's suffering. A long bridge stands ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10154_DESCRIPTION": "After climbing down a steep hill, you grow closer to the great bridge. The miasma around you makes everything creepier as it points towards the enemy.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101600_DESCRIPTION": "Celebrate the New Year in this special once a day dungeon! We hope you enjoy all we have in store this year for Brave Frontier!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10160_DESCRIPTION": "The demon Mora finally reveals her true identity. She says that if you wish to know Karl's whereabouts, you must defeat her first. Can you trust her?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10161_DESCRIPTION": "Crossing the great bridge with Lugina reminds you of your time in Lizeria. With that in mind you wonder how your relationship has made it this far.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10162_DESCRIPTION": "Thanks to Paris and Lugina's help, you won't face many traps along the way. But the demons Mora has sent come at you one after another.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10163_DESCRIPTION": "You may have beaten a disciple, but its presence is not completely gone. Countless disciple-like demons come after you, but you're only halfway there.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10164_DESCRIPTION": "It's battle after battle, but while caught up in them you feel a new,  yet strange power approaching. It feels familiar somehow though...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10165_DESCRIPTION": "After defeating Shusui anew, you head towards the end of the bridge. However, you feel that demonic presence again. You know which demon awaits now.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101700_DESCRIPTION": "The Six Sibyl Sisters were said to have rescued many people. Here lays a shrine dedicated to one of them. Why was it they reached out to save the people?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101701_DESCRIPTION": "The Blaze Sibyl saved the people with an affectionate heart of mercy. However, that in turn led to her fighting her sisters. The sadness from that fight still lingers.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10170_DESCRIPTION": "The demon Mora suddenly appears before you again. What is a demon's shadow? And just what could be going on in Ishgria?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101800_DESCRIPTION": "The ice cold air pricks at your skin, but what awaits ahead is a sibyl said to have a glacial glare even colder than ice.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101801_DESCRIPTION": "A blade of ice that shines clear and bright thanks to the blood of the people it has fed on. Perhaps this is a symbol of her true pure nature. ",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101900_DESCRIPTION": "The land that was once covered with beautiful blossoming flowers now exists as a dark, cold place, just like the memories of the young Rose Sibyl.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_101901_DESCRIPTION": "The young Rose Sibyl was best known for her sweet childlike smile. But do not underestimate her, for pure innocence and pure ruthlessness are two sides of the same coin.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102000_DESCRIPTION": "The sisters once chatted joyfully in the land of thunder. Now, not a trace of their happiness can be found.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102001_DESCRIPTION": "Do these bolts of lightning represent the rage of a sibyl of destruction, or are they her tears, shed over the battle with her sisters? The truth will never be known.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10200_DESCRIPTION": "The lava before you makes you falter a little. No matter how many trying places you've visited, you'll need resolve to get out of this one.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10201_DESCRIPTION": "The air carries the fiery breath of a dragon. There's no doubt that a group of them is nearby. Best move quietly to avoid any confrontations.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10202_DESCRIPTION": "It's so hot you want to resort to Lugina's rude vocabulary to describe the temperature. Your skin stings too, perhaps because you're a bit burnt?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10203_DESCRIPTION": "The sound of the lava flow is unexpectedly pleasant, until you suddenly hear a deafening roar. It might be smart to prepare for battle.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10204_DESCRIPTION": "This hell-like lava path seems to be almost over. However, menacing presences still lurk about. Could this be the demon's assassins?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1020_DESCRIPTION": "The verdant ocean of trees lives up to its name. Wherever you look, the sun's rays are blocked by lush greenery. Under your feet, the ground is covered in grass and moss.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102100_DESCRIPTION": "This sparkling shrine was once the pride of the Six Sisters. Now, without a master, rampant monsters lurk in alongside the souls of the sibyls of destruction.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102101_DESCRIPTION": "The sibyl who had the kindness and mercy to forgive all sins, yet she couldn't save those closest to her. What might she reveal to a Summoner able to capture her?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10210_DESCRIPTION": "Very impactful scenery suddenly comes into view. A deep red sea spreads before your eyes. Its hue makes you realize anew you're in another world.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10211_DESCRIPTION": "Though the sea has a red tint to it, its smell is not strange at all. This disparity makes you uncomfortable and highly confuses you.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10212_DESCRIPTION": "You've seen the sea dyed by the colors of the sunset before, but you're sure this water's hue is something entirely different. You start feeling sick.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10213_DESCRIPTION": "The \"Six Armors\" that Mora mentioned, which rival demonic powers, start to bug you. You may have to fight them in the future.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10214_DESCRIPTION": "Are all of Ishgria's oceans red? While thinking that to yourself, a horde of enemies shows up. This is no time to take it easy.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1021_DESCRIPTION": "Unlike the tundra, the forest is full of what looks like landmarks. But they are starting to lead you astray as you trip over the thick grass.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102200_DESCRIPTION": "The shrine sparkles like a star scattered sky. Just like the night sky it is breathtaking yet terrifying, awakening one's primal fear of the dark. ",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102201_DESCRIPTION": "She was too engrossed in pursuing her ideals which is why she couldn't forgive anything. Regardless the passage of time, this never changed.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10220_DESCRIPTION": "Seria was right. This place really doesn't resemble a laboratory. However, if you look closely you'll see a lot of strange equipment.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10221_DESCRIPTION": "The ruins turned laboratory are being swallowed by the forest. You can feel great vitality coming from the plants growing along the walls.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10222_DESCRIPTION": "Even though the facility has been eroded by the forest, a part of it still seems to be alive. The science behind it was indeed efficient.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10223_DESCRIPTION": "A very misplaced and dense floral aroma drifts in the air. You still don't know much about Ishgria's nature, so you would do well to be cautious.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10224_DESCRIPTION": "You're almost out of the laboratory, but Lugina and Paris are still nowhere to be seen. Seria's also taken her own path, so just keep moving forward.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1022_DESCRIPTION": "All of a sudden, sunshine bathes you as the old growth gives way to young foliage. The fresh flowers are a pleasure to your senses.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10230_DESCRIPTION": "As something fearsome drops from the heavens and comes after you, you realize there is no room to talk. The battle has already started.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10231_DESCRIPTION": "The strong wind doesn't cease blowing. The wood of the gigantic and heavy windmill towering over you makes a loud creaking noise as it turns.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10232_DESCRIPTION": "The strong wind may be somewhat depressing, but at least it's neither too hot nor too cold. There's no apparent danger in sight either.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10233_DESCRIPTION": "A violent squall almost sent you flying. Looks like this is yet another place where you can't let your guard down. Be careful.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10234_DESCRIPTION": "Though the windmill seems pretty old, it is still in very good condition, and even mobile. Could this have been the energy source for the lab?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1023_DESCRIPTION": "You happen upon an old tree that manages to stand out in the ocean of its peers. Though not much taller than the others, it is far wider. You must make your way around it.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10240_DESCRIPTION": "Beiorg shows himself before you again. Would it be wise to fight this enemy with a function that makes him stronger after every defeat?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10241_DESCRIPTION": "While looking at the landscape you realize that both demons and humans must have lived here long ago. Could humans really have inhabited Ishgria?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10242_DESCRIPTION": "After passing numerous alleys on a hill, you finally find the main road. However, where could the inhabitants of such a great city have gone?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10243_DESCRIPTION": "When you turn on a corner of the main road, you see that a group of enemies has been waiting for you. Could these be the protectors of this old city?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10244_DESCRIPTION": "You have reached the outer wall of the old city. It may be due to the materials it's made of, but it's still somehow untarnished and pearly white.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1024_DESCRIPTION": "Further into the ocean of trees you see some covered in exquisite flowers. Their petals rain down as the armored princess and gunner from another world approach.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10250_DESCRIPTION": "If you climb this set of strange-looking stairs, you will reach the old castle. However, climbing all these stairs is slightly depressing.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10251_DESCRIPTION": "The stairs keep going up, and up. You start to worry about Owen, but according to what Seria and Lugina said, you just have to trust he's fine.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10252_DESCRIPTION": "Even though there seems to be no end to this staircase, the enemies don't find it a problem to attack you. Be careful not to miss your step and fall.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10253_DESCRIPTION": "Due to the nature of this place, you can't avoid any fights. On top of that, enemies keep attacking you from high places, so you're in a tough spot.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10254_DESCRIPTION": "You can see the entrance to the castle. Once you clear the next wave of enemies, you should be able to go inside. That's where the real battle awaits.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10260_DESCRIPTION": "You destroy all the mechanisms you see before you as you move forth. It's possible that Karl is here, but what would he be doing in this place?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10261_DESCRIPTION": "As you look at the lights that flash on the floors and walls, you feel as if you had been swallowed by a giant machine. Perhaps that's what happened?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10262_DESCRIPTION": "You keep destroying all the equipment you lay your eyes upon, but nothing seems to happen. What is the purpose of all these gadgets anyway?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10263_DESCRIPTION": "Beiorg seems to be able to alter his stature and size, but there's no way he'd make the castle a part of his body...is there?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10264_DESCRIPTION": "By the way, where did Beiorg run off to? If this place is as important as Mora claims, then he should be here to protect it, and yet...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10265_DESCRIPTION": "As you wander around the silent castle, you hear a strange sound echo through its halls. It seems like Beiorg is on his way to you after all!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_10270_DESCRIPTION": "Behind the castle and down the cliff lies a forest of dry trees. Will another demonic shadow show itself here? No more demons should be around, but...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102800_DESCRIPTION": "Entry to the Mysterious Paradise is only granted once a day. Croaking voices can be heard echoing in the distance.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_102810_DESCRIPTION": "Entry to the Ultimate Paradise is only granted once a day. Not only are there croaking voices, something can be seen sparkling from inside.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1110_DESCRIPTION": "Zurg... What could the last of the Fallen Gods be plotting. You can't help but wonder as you gaze upon the beautiful aquatic metropolis.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1111_DESCRIPTION": "You can see to the bottom of the beautifully flowing river. Remembering Zurg's words, you search for a path to Vriksha.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1112_DESCRIPTION": "A gorgeous palace stands in the center of town. However, the fountain in its courtyard stands frozen. Soon an ice wielding hero is upon you.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1114_DESCRIPTION": "You can see a massive object blocking the exit from the Sea Capital. There's no mistake, it's the legendary freezing weapon.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1120_DESCRIPTION": "This forest was once home to a prosperous city, the ruins of which can be seen periodically through the undergrowth. What could've happened to it?",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1123_DESCRIPTION": "Though Lugina warned you not to overthink things, you can't help but get lost in thought. Something just isn't right.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1124_DESCRIPTION": "You're nearly out of the forest, but you must defeat the legendary guardian before you. Prepare yourself as you face off with the stone-like guardian.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1130_DESCRIPTION": "Just past the bridge is Alnakeid Castle. You must defeat the wicked presence there to proceed to Vriksha, as far off as it may still be.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1131_DESCRIPTION": "Passing the castle walls, you venture through a watch tower to find another wall. The roar of lightning around you holds the power of a massive army.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1132_DESCRIPTION": "Doubt grows within you. The Four Fallen Gods should have been fighting together. What difference is there in the disputes between gods and humans?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1133_DESCRIPTION": "There are now cracks to be found in the fortress walls. As unnecessary as it is, the stronghold between the three capitals still serves its purpose.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1134_DESCRIPTION": "A fight awaits you at Danrard's final gate. You're greeted by an angel who once took to the sky in search of freedom.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1140_DESCRIPTION": "Though it now lies in ruins, the town remains lit by a glass-sided, gravestone-like tower. The scene is quite mysterious.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1141_DESCRIPTION": "Could scenes like this be commonplace in the otherworld? Also, what happened to the god who was supposed to have destroyed this town?",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1152_DESCRIPTION": "As the enemy's attack reaches a whole new level, you sense a powerful force coming from deep inside the cave. Surely, a strong foe awaits.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1153_DESCRIPTION": "Exhausted by all the fighting, you stop for a quick break. However, upon moving forward a chill runs down your spine. Something wicked lies ahead...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1154_DESCRIPTION": "Feeling the wind, you realize you might soon be out of the cave. But before proceeding, you must first defeat a legendary demon.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1160_DESCRIPTION": "Entering the hall, you're surrounded by enemies. You must defeat them before moving forward, as exhausted as you may be.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1161_DESCRIPTION": "Leaving the hall, you come across a pair of foes harvesting the powers of light and dark. Defeat the minions before taking on these two.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1162_DESCRIPTION": "You exit into a grand space decorated with swords. The countless scars that adorn the walls and pillars show the intense battle that took place here.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1163_DESCRIPTION": "This seems to be the courtyard. It is lined with beautiful sculptures, and the pond is filled with clean water. However, enemies still lurk nearby.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1164_DESCRIPTION": "Entering once again inside, your eyes spot a great fireplace glowing red. Nearby, in the dimly lit room, stands a chair made of leather.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1165_DESCRIPTION": "You exit onto the castle's roof. The god Zurg spoke of should be at the top of the tower ahead. However, a hero of lightning blocks your way.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1166_DESCRIPTION": "You've reached the spiral staircase inside the tower of the castle. It isn't tall, but it's full of enemies, the strongest awaiting you at the end.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_11_DESCRIPTION": "The calm grasslands keep on going.The monsters here are just right for a beginner.Keep moving forward.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1200_DESCRIPTION": "It seems that Zurg's words are still bothering Tilith. Keep moving forward to bring her spirits back up, never looking back.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1201_DESCRIPTION": "Though the temperature is rising, the morale of your party never wanes. Combine your powers and aim for the last Fallen God together.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1202_DESCRIPTION": "The cries of the drake echo through the mountains, but this is no foe to fear now. Make your way through the scorching path ahead as fast as you can.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1203_DESCRIPTION": "As if answering to your fighting spirit, strong warriors await ahead. Enveloped in wings of flames, these two swordsmen are swelling with energy. ",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1204_DESCRIPTION": "A gigantic shadow blocks your path at the top of the mountain. It seems there is no way to pass through the volcano without a confrontation.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1210_DESCRIPTION": "It looks like something's on Tilith's mind. If everyone said they trust her, then what could be wrong? It's a tad worrisome.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1211_DESCRIPTION": "Surprised by the sounds of footsteps, they turn out to be only small crabs. Walking on the rocky area washed by the waves, you feel like you'll slip.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1212_DESCRIPTION": "The sounds of waves mix with a voice in song. They sing the magical song of a water spirit. The enemy isn't strong, but don't let it slow you down.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1213_DESCRIPTION": "You reach the sand after the rocky area. A hero with an ambition as great as the sea, and another with a will of ice, ambush you upon arrival.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1214_DESCRIPTION": "The cliff in the distance you were headed towards begins to move. It was actually your enemy, and you have no choice but to defeat it to move forward.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1220_DESCRIPTION": "What could be the truth Zurg keeps mentioning? Regardless of how reliable his testimony may be, it still gets the imagination going.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1221_DESCRIPTION": "The forest capital of Vriksha. Seeing how much it truly differs from the Vriksha of yore, you can't help but wonder what happened to this country.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1222_DESCRIPTION": "Strange, this is the same path you took before. It seems that the forest is enchanted. You must find the source of this spell and eliminate it.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1223_DESCRIPTION": "Exiting to an open space lit by the sun, the birds shriek. A hero with a weapon from another world, and another with a magic lance, stand before you.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1224_DESCRIPTION": "A mountain made of stone suddenly appears before you. Just when you thought it was in your way, it swings at you. It's a puppet controlled by magic!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1230_DESCRIPTION": "Though Paris is hostile towards the Summoners' Hall, there's a particular antagonism in the air when she looks at Grahdens. It must mean something.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1231_DESCRIPTION": "Water tainted red and a mysterious creature shining light by it. Out of all the places you've been to so far, this one feels the eeriest. Be careful.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1232_DESCRIPTION": "A deafening voice combined with the flash of thunder. A bird soars the skies creating electric shocks as it revolves. But it's not just one bird...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1233_DESCRIPTION": "As the thunder clouds roar in the sky, rain starts to fall. At the same time, two heroes appear and obstruct your path. You sense a fight is imminent.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1234_DESCRIPTION": "The rain has ceased and light trickles through the clouds. As if on a staircase of light, an angel descends. Defeat her and proceed to the Sky Palace.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1240_DESCRIPTION": "No matter how true Zurg's words may be, helping him to destroy humans is not an option. Of course, you wouldn't betray the Goddess anyway.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1241_DESCRIPTION": "You can't believe that such a beautiful garden floats in midair just like that. What sort of magic could be at work here?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1242_DESCRIPTION": "A fighting goddess forbids you from moving forward, as if she cannot forgive those who disturb her garden. However, there's no stopping now.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1243_DESCRIPTION": "You reach the castle at the heart of the garden. When you set foot there, a hero wielding a holy blade and a knight with a great sword appear.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1244_DESCRIPTION": "You can see the gate that marks the exit of the Sky Palace. However, in front of it stands a shiny and pale king of beasts. It's time for battle.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1250_DESCRIPTION": "Tilith seems to be feeling better, which is a relief. No one else is hung up on Zurg's words either. With a unified front, head towards Adan's Tower.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1251_DESCRIPTION": "This eerie place makes it feel like ghosts could appear at any moment. Proceed with caution. You're getting closer to enemy territory now.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1252_DESCRIPTION": "A feeling of uneasiness lingers in the air, but you travel lightly on your feet. Knowing you must defeat the Fallen God, there's no time to waste.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1253_DESCRIPTION": "The ill wills of revenge and madness prevent you from stepping any further. The hero waiting ahead looks powerful, so prepare yourself.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1254_DESCRIPTION": "A young woman awaits outside the rear gate of the castle. It would seem she's holding a sword in her right hand, and concentrated magic on the other.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1260_DESCRIPTION": "The surroundings are overflowing with the presence of the enemy. Head for the top while Karl serves as a distraction. The real battle draws near.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1261_DESCRIPTION": "You cannot find the staircase that leads upstairs, so you take the only way available deep inside. The path seems slanted, slowly curving upwards.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1262_DESCRIPTION": "The curved hallway spirals upwards and upwards. If you stumble when you lose in battle, you may end up tumbling all the way down...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1263_DESCRIPTION": "You reach the top to find a large room. As if the same type of powerful enemy had been waiting for you all along, you're suddenly attacked.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1264_DESCRIPTION": "You go upstairs, open the doors, and find another large room. After just one step, the doors close and a strong enemy is summoned. Just a bit more.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1265_DESCRIPTION": "After a fierce battle, you climb your way up through some narrow stairs. On your way to the top an enemy shows itself, but there's no going back now!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1266_DESCRIPTION": "Finally at the top, there's no doubt that Zurg is waiting. If you defeat the disciple of the last Fallen God, Afla Dilith will be the only enemy left!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_12_DESCRIPTION": "You can see a rocky mountain faintly on the horizon. Tilith is waiting at the \"Cave of Flames\" just beyond here.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1300_DESCRIPTION": "You look far into the distance and notice the shadow of an eerie castle. They say that it is the last form Afla Dilith morphed into...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1301_DESCRIPTION": "The footprints of Lugina and the others who had gone ahead have vanished. Strong gusts of wind hit the sand dunes, continuously changing their shape.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1302_DESCRIPTION": "The blazing sun is wearing you down, dehydrating you. You've crossed many scorching territories so far, but somehow never seem to grow used to them.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1303_DESCRIPTION": "As the sparkling sand reflects the sunlight, your feet grow hotter and hotter. At this rate they'll end up well-done while they roast...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1304_DESCRIPTION": "Your thirst and the sun aren't your only enemies. Afla Dilith has dispatched assassins who are closing in on you. The end of the desert isn't far now.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1310_DESCRIPTION": "Indeed there are other gods besides the Four Fallen that reject the existence of humans. However, let's focus on the task at hand for now.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1311_DESCRIPTION": "The sun shines through an ice wall and though no light is lit within the temple, it's bright inside. The light suddenly refracts, creating a rainbow.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1312_DESCRIPTION": "The solitude of the ice temple makes for a very relaxing atmosphere. However, with enemies incoming, you have no time to rest.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1313_DESCRIPTION": "Could this temple also be the work of the gods? Or is it the masterpiece of a person with otherworldly powers? It piques your curiosity.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1314_DESCRIPTION": "Everything is gradually turning brighter. The exit may be close, but things will probably not be as simple as you think.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1320_DESCRIPTION": "An ancient forest that few have visited before. There seem to be no natural paths. You'll have to use your sense of direction to get out of this one.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1321_DESCRIPTION": "A strange feeling overcomes you. You've sensed this atmosphere in many of the forests you have passed through so far. No doubt spirits are near.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1322_DESCRIPTION": "Along with a shrilling cry, a flock of birds flies off frightened. A loud roar follows after. It's the sound of an otherworldly machine at work!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1323_DESCRIPTION": "You get the feeling that something is inviting you deep into the sea of trees. You can't help thinking you're being led to a den full of enemies.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1324_DESCRIPTION": "The space between the trees has widened. The end of the forest may be near. This can only mean that enemies more powerful than before await you.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1330_DESCRIPTION": "The fate of the future... What Paris told you is starting to make sense. However, you must first focus on defeating the last Fallen God.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1331_DESCRIPTION": "The large drops of rain won't stop, striking you as they fall. Your body gets colder, and as you sneeze, the sound of thunder resonates around you.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1332_DESCRIPTION": "You can tell that in Aldahlia the buildings soaked in rainwater have been eroding away. You start to wonder how long this rain will keep falling.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1333_DESCRIPTION": "A bright bolt of lightning tears the sky apart. After a second of waiting, a deafening sound hits your ears. Lighting struck dangerously close.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1334_DESCRIPTION": "The continuous roaring of the thunder has made your ears feel funny. You wouldn't survive an ambush in this state, so you best be cautious.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1340_DESCRIPTION": "It's still a long way to Afla Dilith, but everyone keeps talking about what will come after that. Let's not worry about those things for now.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1341_DESCRIPTION": "The herd of Pegasus was just frightened, but something more alarming soars the skies. War goddesses spread their wings to prepare for battle.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1342_DESCRIPTION": "This road offers a clear view of the surroundings, so there's no fear of an ambush. However, there's nothing you can use to deflect aerial attacks.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1343_DESCRIPTION": "How long have you advanced? Now you can really see the castle Afla Dilith has assimilated with. Is that what you will face in the future?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1344_DESCRIPTION": "A road for pilgrims. Long ago, pilgrims passed through here to pray to the gods. Ironically, you're taking this road in order to defeat a god.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1345_DESCRIPTION": "The end of the road is near. A strong power can be felt coming from it. The enemy lurking there will most likely be your last obstacle here.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1351_DESCRIPTION": "There are still many enemies left on the way to the castle. Surely Karl and the others will have to face even more of them as you move on ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1352_DESCRIPTION": "The sound of your allies fighting behind you grows louder. Head towards the castle while everyone else draws the enemies' attention.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1353_DESCRIPTION": "The enemies in your path continue getting stronger. It can only mean that your last target is drawing near. The castle's gates should be just ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1354_DESCRIPTION": "The castle is within a stone's throw, and the god's powerful presence grows stronger. However, it's no time to buckle under pressure. Step inside.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1355_DESCRIPTION": "You can see the last hoard of enemies in front of the gate. If you can get past them, you will finally be inside Afla Dilith!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1360_DESCRIPTION": "Tilith, Karl, everyone... You're worried about the friends you left behind fighting. However, there's no turning back now. You must press forward.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1361_DESCRIPTION": "Looking inside the castle, nothing really seems out of place. Although without Tilith's protective barrier, you might have fallen prey to Afla Dilith.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1363_DESCRIPTION": "As you proceed further in, the sounds of battle coming from the entrance disappear. You can still feel Tilith's barrier protecting you, though.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1364_DESCRIPTION": "You've made your way through a big portion of the fortress. Past this corridor lies its center. The real body of the Fallen God is probably there.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1401_DESCRIPTION": "A beautiful singing voice lingers in the air. Could this be the work of a demon as well? And why have so many monsters gathered in this ghost town?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1402_DESCRIPTION": "How strange. No matter how much you advance, you keep finding yourself back where you started. It's like being in the fairies' grove all over again.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1403_DESCRIPTION": "There are too many enemies. What could've led them here? As you think that to yourself, a piercing and thunderous sound resonates around you.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1404_DESCRIPTION": "The neigh of a Pegasus reaches your ears, a pure sound ill-fitted for this ghost town. A battle with the maidens awaits ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1405_DESCRIPTION": "You can feel many more enemies obstructing your way now. If you're lucky enough, defeating the last hoard of them might be your ticket out of here. ",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1411_DESCRIPTION": "You confirm the sun's location to avoid losing your way. Short on patience and with your body almost boiling, beads of sweat fall from your forehead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1412_DESCRIPTION": "A cloud of sand starts covering your clothes. You swallow the fine pieces of sand the wind picks up as you breathe. Deserts are still not your forte.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1413_DESCRIPTION": "As the sunshine gets hotter, heat haze begins to rise from beneath. Beyond the shaky mirage in front of you, you spy the creeping shadow of the enemy.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1414_DESCRIPTION": "A cloudless, blue firmament above, and scorching, yellow sand beneath. As you look behind you, everything grows darker. A sandstorm is on its way.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1420_DESCRIPTION": "After leaving the great the desert behind, you come across a river so big that the shore seems invisible. It will take a lot of effort to cross it.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1421_DESCRIPTION": "At times, the river fish jump high up. Surprised by the sound, you finally see the enemy closing in. You realize now the fish were trying to warn you.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1422_DESCRIPTION": "Halfway up the river you hear a creaking noise and see that the surface of the river has begun to freeze. It seems the enemy is here.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1423_DESCRIPTION": "As you admire the grandeur of this river, you reminisce of battle. Even though you have defeated the Four Fallen Gods, other battles still lie ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1424_DESCRIPTION": "A strong wind blows. The water's surface ripples, and then crashes in a big splash. It may be a sign of the road up ahead, which makes you nervous.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1430_DESCRIPTION": "As you walk through the thick forest, you get lost. The path to a free future... You'll have to make your own way to get there.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1431_DESCRIPTION": "You arrive at a place in the forest where a small spring bubbles. You consider taking a rest, but enemies start appearing one by one. Break's over.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1432_DESCRIPTION": "A strong wind blows in the forest. As the leaves brush upon each other they sound like the waves of the ocean. It's a sea of trees indeed.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1433_DESCRIPTION": "Breeze blows strongly through the trees, picking up old leaves, and fluttering new ones. This is the force that transforms the forest anew.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1434_DESCRIPTION": "The sea of trees sways as the wind hits it. One could say that even these living beings feel anxious about the future fate of the world.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1440_DESCRIPTION": "The rough, shiny rock around shows traces of lightning. It seems it has been absorbing it during the endless storms. Pressing forward won't be easy.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1441_DESCRIPTION": "As you climb an electrified cliff, you pass peaks as sharp as needles. You can't help but feel like this road is a premonition of the future to come.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1442_DESCRIPTION": "The thunder and lightning that falls here is absorbed by the mountain. It has accumulated so much after the years that it might burst any minute now.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1443_DESCRIPTION": "You've reached the Mt. Granakia's highest peak, where you can see the whole of Atharva. You see a giant castle in the distance. Is that Eriole's base?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1444_DESCRIPTION": "You can see Paris at the bottom of the cliff. It seems she followed you here. You were told to talk to her, but what exactly do you have in mind?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1450_DESCRIPTION": "After climbing over the mountain, you reach a beautiful garden. However, no people seem to come here, so how has it been kept so well maintained?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1451_DESCRIPTION": "Beautiful flower beds are arranged next to each other in the garden. These amazing flowers couldn't have bloomed without lots of care, and yet...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1452_DESCRIPTION": "You can see a fountain amidst the flower beds. The water sparkles as it flows from a beautifully carved pedestal. What a great spectacle to behold.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1453_DESCRIPTION": "Small birds flutter about, chirping a song. One flees suddenly, and when you follow it with your eyes, you see a great shadow dropping from the sky...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1454_DESCRIPTION": "The floral aroma, the chirping of the birds, and the beauty of the trimmed hedges... Looking at it now, this is a beautiful, if not perfect, garden.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1455_DESCRIPTION": "Could this garden have been made by human hands? How could it have remained so beautiful without any people left to care for it?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1456_DESCRIPTION": "Small flowers sway in the wind, butterflies flutter about, and the birds fly high in the sky. A wind of new beginnings is leaving the old age behind.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1460_DESCRIPTION": "Having passed the gorgeous garden, you reach a gloomy cemetery. Among the expressionless tombstones standing, a voice calls from within the silence.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1461_DESCRIPTION": "Tesla said Paris was useless to them now. If Eriole truly feels that way, then just what could he be after...?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1462_DESCRIPTION": "This part of the cemetery seems to be dedicated to soldiers fallen in battle. You can see that their tombstones have a sword symbol carved onto them.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1463_DESCRIPTION": "If a civil war breaks in Elgaia, many lives will be lost. This must be prevented at all costs.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1464_DESCRIPTION": "Reading the few words you can make out from the headstones, you gather that this was once one of the most important places in Atharva.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1465_DESCRIPTION": "You feel something cold run down your spine. Feeling an evil presence, you look around you. Darkness is closing in, the enemy's coming!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1466_DESCRIPTION": "Not even the wind seems to reach this place, and your movements start to feel sluggish. The smell of moss and mold lingers in the air.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1470_DESCRIPTION": "The spark of battle has been ignited. Defeat the enemies standing in your way, and head towards the depths of Eriole's castle!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1471_DESCRIPTION": "A cold steel blade strikes at you, and fiery claws rush towards you. No matter who the enemy may be, you must not falter!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1472_DESCRIPTION": "A fist cracks the floor open, and a lance tries to pierce you as you counterattack. Strong enemies have gathered here, but you must press on!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1473_DESCRIPTION": "Lightning flashes in the hall, and a sword that seems to block darkness shimmers brightly. If you want to stop the revolution, focus on the enemy now!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1474_DESCRIPTION": "Light pierces the walls, and countless arrows begin to rain down. The enemy is strong, but you still have morale. Hurry and make your way through!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1475_DESCRIPTION": "Dual blades dance in the air, and one strike from a hefty lance breaks the floor open. Just a bit more till you face Eriole deep in the castle.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1476_DESCRIPTION": "The shadow overhead is just as strong as the light. The world is being distorted, probably tearing at the seams. You're just steps away from Eriole!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1477_DESCRIPTION": "Eriole's ideas are warped. The idea that a bloody revolution can bring about a peaceful future cannot possibly be true. He must be stopped.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1480_DESCRIPTION": "You discover a cave dispersing an ominous miasma. There are traces of a strong seal at the entrance, but you seem to be able to come and go freely.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1570_DESCRIPTION": "The battle has finally begun. Lucius seems to have no intentions of listening to humans. Tilith's words are also cause for concern...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1571_DESCRIPTION": "If Lucius is defeated, only Tilith will be able to control the gate. You must think of a countermeasure to deal with the sealed calamities within.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1574_DESCRIPTION": "Lucius doesn't speak much. Did he fool everyone? Or did humans selfishly come up with their own expectations of him?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_1575_DESCRIPTION": "You wonder if Karl and the others are unharmed. They must have crossed many a powerful enemy on the way here. Quickly, you must reach Lucius!",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20064_DESCRIPTION": "The carvings here are even more ornate than those near the entrance of the ruins. A fresh gash runs horizontally across one of the giant frescoes. What could've done this?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20065_DESCRIPTION": "Continuing deeper into the ruins in search of the strange sensation’s source, you come across souls driven mad mad by anger. What could have done this?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20066_DESCRIPTION": "The source of the strange sensation is revealed in a legendary giants with powers rivaling those of the gods. Do you run, or stay and fight?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20067_DESCRIPTION": "After defeating the giants, you now face the toughest challenge of all in their king, Grantos. The final showdown to determine the fate of Cordelica is about to begin.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20070_DESCRIPTION": "There's a cavern just behind the Ignia Falls. A mysterious beast has awaken deep inside, seemingly disturbed by your battle with the giants. What could it be?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_200_DESCRIPTION": "Your journey through Morgan begins in a huge desert. The scorching haze indicates the fierce battle to come.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_201_DESCRIPTION": "The bandits in this burning desert have much stronger resolve that those in Mistral, and it seems they intend to block your way.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_204_DESCRIPTION": "The end of the desert is in view, and the wind now smells of the sea. However, a giant silhouette stands blocks your path...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_20_DESCRIPTION": "The magma flowing within this cave gives off an intense heat. The enemies in this cave have the power of fire.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_210_DESCRIPTION": "You've reached the shore, escaping the desert. A calm, beautiful beach awaits you, but you must still be cautious.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_211_DESCRIPTION": "A huge ship is anchored on the beach. It's a pirate ship, and it seems there's no easy way past...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_212_DESCRIPTION": "The beautiful view continues, as do the number of enemies you encounter. Prepare yourself for a water assault.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_213_DESCRIPTION": "The end of the coastline is now in view. A Water Spirit is said to appear around here. How strong could it be?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_214_DESCRIPTION": "You've finally reached the coast's end. A dark forest is visible ahead, but surely something is lurking near...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_21_DESCRIPTION": "Continue deeper into the Cave of Flames. Beings who control fire are waiting ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_220_DESCRIPTION": "Your eyes haven't adjusted to the dark since coming in from the coast. Are Karl and the others OK?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_221_DESCRIPTION": "Dark forests like this are usually full of bandits. Is it that they work better in the Dark? Either way, be careful.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_222_DESCRIPTION": "The discomfort you felt in the forests of Mistral is back, but this time it's worse. Could this be the work of a time mage?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_223_DESCRIPTION": "It's hard telling which trees are just trees and not just monsters in hiding. If only you could escape this forest...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_224_DESCRIPTION": "The darkness has lightened. The exit should be close, but there's tension in the air. Surely, the sign of a formidable foe.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_22_DESCRIPTION": "You've come far, but there's still no exit in site. There are supposed to be bandits in this area.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_230_DESCRIPTION": "After escaping the pitch black forest, you entered a vast wasteland. The area is being torn apart by lightning.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_231_DESCRIPTION": "You move forward as lightning strikes down all around you. Beware of incoming aerial attacks.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_232_DESCRIPTION": "You're nearing the center of the wastelands. Did Karl and his team successfully bring down the demon they were chasing?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_233_DESCRIPTION": "There's a temple barely visible in the distance. There's no sign of Karl, what has happened to him...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_234_DESCRIPTION": "A summoned thunder king is blocking the path at the end of the wasteland. You must defeat him before continuing.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_23_DESCRIPTION": "Looks like you'll be able to leave this cave soon, but there seems to be something sinister awaiting you at the end.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_240_DESCRIPTION": "There is a temple bathed in light. Despite it being thousands of years old, it's as beautiful as the day it was built.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_241_DESCRIPTION": "You continue even deeper into the massive temple. You can make out the solemn silhouettes of pegasi standing about.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_242_DESCRIPTION": "You've nearly reached the middle of the temple. You can imagine the days when many would gather at this impressive alter.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_243_DESCRIPTION": "You can feel the enemies growing stronger the deeper you go. Unfortunately, the only way to the Tower of Morgan is forward.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_244_DESCRIPTION": "You reached the temple's innermost area. A mighty swordsman awaits you, and you can surely expect a fierce battle...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_250_DESCRIPTION": "You see ruins as you escape from the temple. It seems that whatever existed here before was destroyed by a great power.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_251_DESCRIPTION": "As you proceed, you realize the ruins cover a large area. It must have been a large city before.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_252_DESCRIPTION": "You've come to a plaza in the middle of the ruins. An enormous church embodies the former power of this devastated city.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_253_DESCRIPTION": "Leaving the church, you continue through the ruins. The temple was so beautifully preserved, what could've happened here?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_254_DESCRIPTION": "You reached the ruins' end. The majestic Tower of Morgan stands before you. However, a knight in thick armor awaits...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_260_DESCRIPTION": "Don't let Karl and Seria's wishes go to waste. Ascend the tower quickly and track down Abaddon and Graham!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_261_DESCRIPTION": "This tower is like a gigantic fortress. The spiral stairs that surround its vast outer walls are the only way up...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_262_DESCRIPTION": "Is this only the halfway point? You can still hear the cries from the fierce battle raging below... It's time to hurry.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_263_DESCRIPTION": "Past the halfway point, warriors summoned by Maxwell and Abaddon block the path. There's no turning back now.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_264_DESCRIPTION": "The Stairway to the Heavens has narrowed. You can no longer hear the shouts from the base. You're almost there.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_265_DESCRIPTION": "You've reached the top at last. Continue on and defeat Abaddon and Graham, you can't let Karl and the others down!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_2_DESCRIPTION": "Memorize the strengths and weaknesses of each elements and how to trigger the Brave Burst!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_3000000_DESCRIPTION": "Welcome to a special dungeon created in honor of Brave Frontier's 1 year anniversary. Tough enemies await you to help you remember the good 'ol days!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_3000010_DESCRIPTION": "A system Noel created in order to help Summoners train themselves. Strong opponents will attack any challenger that steps before them.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_300_DESCRIPTION": "You're now in Maxwell's stronghold, St. Lamia. Many tall mountains are visible in the distance. The land looks rugged.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_301_DESCRIPTION": "Magma is gushing out all over, and it's scorching hot as far as the eye can see. Nothing could possibly live here.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_302_DESCRIPTION": "It's getting hotter and hotter as you near the mouth of the volcano. It's getting hard to even move...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_303_DESCRIPTION": "You finally made it through the pass. The intense heat hasn't gone, but at least it's all downhill from here. Hurry on ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_304_DESCRIPTION": "Just as you were about to escape the volcano, it seems an undead beast is blocking your path...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_30_DESCRIPTION": "You've emerged into a blizzard. It's so cold, watch out for enemies with water attacks.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_310_DESCRIPTION": "You've emerged from the base of a mountain. Now it's intensely cold, and it seems to be taking its toll on Tilith. ",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_311_DESCRIPTION": "Unlike the Volcano Eldent, this blizzard-covered sacred mountain has many steep cliffs. Watch your step.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_312_DESCRIPTION": "This place is also inhabitable. It's doubtful anyone could even last a minute around here. Hurry on ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_313_DESCRIPTION": "Around the summit, stones are stacked in a alter-like pattern. Is this proof that the mountain was a place of worship?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_314_DESCRIPTION": "The summit is in sight, and you've spotted the altar. The end is near, but there are signs of a beast nearby...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_31_DESCRIPTION": "You are making progress, but the end of the snowscape still isn't visible. Don't forget to plan for water enemies.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_320_DESCRIPTION": "Beyond the sacred mountain lies the Blood Forest. Tilith is acting a bit odd, though, she might be sick...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_321_DESCRIPTION": "A sea of red surrounds you as you walk through this forest. The grass, the flowers, everythings red. What's the meaning of this?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_322_DESCRIPTION": "You continue deeper into the crimson forest. Suddenly, drops as red as blood fall down on you from the trees above.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_323_DESCRIPTION": "You feel your senses numbing as you're enveloped in a sea of red. It's probably not a good idea to stick around here.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_324_DESCRIPTION": "You've finally reached the end of the crimson forest. You see a color other than red and race towards it.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_32_DESCRIPTION": "You've reached the center of the icy field. Beware, apparently there are pirates about on the ice...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_330_DESCRIPTION": "You're halfway through St. Lamia, and Tilith's deteriorating condition has worsened. It's time to hurry.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_331_DESCRIPTION": "Mt. Wistorea is the steepest in the area, but its calm weather makes it the most comfortable environment so far.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_332_DESCRIPTION": "Hold off the hordes of giants as you move forward. You can't waste time with Tilith's current condition.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_333_DESCRIPTION": "The Thunderbird circles above, letting out a piercing cry. You've no choice but to confront it and take it down.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_334_DESCRIPTION": "You can make out St. Lamia Palace in the distance, but the roar of a beast from the foothills nearby are concerning...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_33_DESCRIPTION": "The end of this cold snow field has come into view at last. However, it seems one of Maxwell's knights is waiting just ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_340_DESCRIPTION": "You come across a clearing bathed in a dazzling light, but as Tilith's curse is growing stronger there is no time to enjoy it.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_341_DESCRIPTION": "This area is obviously sacred, bathed in light and covered in green, but being so close to St. Lamia Palace surely strong foes await.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_342_DESCRIPTION": "Without provocation, hordes of shining demons swoop down on you. These demons must've been called upon by Maxwell...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_343_DESCRIPTION": "Seems even a holy goddess has been called on to block your path. However, you must defeat her and press on if you're to save Tilith.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_344_DESCRIPTION": "The exit is in sight, but a giant entity can be seen swooping down from the heavens, possibly to deliver your final trial...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_350_DESCRIPTION": "In a complete change of scenery, you come across a dark, rancid cave. Pass through this, and St. Lamia Palace awaits.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_351_DESCRIPTION": "This cave not only looks horrid, but is also full to the brim with fearsome beings. You mustn't lose focus here or else.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_352_DESCRIPTION": "There is a nagging chill in the air, though it isn't necessarily cold. Could it be this malicious air that surrounds you?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_353_DESCRIPTION": "It seems you've reached the dark, damp reaches of this hellish cave. Follow the wind to find your way out.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_354_DESCRIPTION": "You seem to have finally figured your way out of the cave, but all of the sudden an unsettling evil presence descends upon you...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_360_DESCRIPTION": "You've finally reached Maxwell's stronghold. You continue forward, having vowed to Tilith to destroy this depraved god.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_361_DESCRIPTION": "This castle once was revered for its majesty. While still impressive, it's surrounded in a sinister atmosphere.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_362_DESCRIPTION": "As expected, Maxwell has filled her base with incredibly powerful beings. Liberating them is going to be difficult.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_363_DESCRIPTION": "You've entered the castle's banquet hall. The sacred walls reek of wickedness, but you mustn't hesitate. Advance, for Tilith!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_364_DESCRIPTION": "You can feel the fallen god's presence grow stronger as you proceed. However, surely she has set up a powerful defensive line before her.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_365_DESCRIPTION": "At last, you've reached Maxwell. The battle to save Tilith and destroy the first of the four fallen gods begins now...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_3_DESCRIPTION": "Practice combat while using everything you've learned!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_400_DESCRIPTION": "Amdahl, one of the islands in the Palmyna Archipelago which is ruled over by Cardes the Malevolent. A town can be seen near the entrance, having been devastated by war. ",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_401_DESCRIPTION": "Past the damaged houses lies nothing but fiery ruins. Could these flames be the work of monsters?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_402_DESCRIPTION": "You can feel the flames growing stronger. This might be a sign that something dangerous is waiting ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_403_DESCRIPTION": "When lightning strikes it sometimes ignites the earth where it hits. The force that controls the lightning and flames has set their aim on you.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_404_DESCRIPTION": "A figure watches you from the shadows as you attempt to leave the village. It seems all the intense fighting has attracted the attention of a fire god.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_40_DESCRIPTION": "Beyond the snow lie the forests that the sun doesn't reach. Beware, there are signs of monsters are all around.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_410_DESCRIPTION": "Monsters snarl in unison as they scheme to make you their main dish at this ghost ship party.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_411_DESCRIPTION": "What could be waiting unbeknownst to history in this ship that appeared so long ago? You can't deny your curiosity.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_412_DESCRIPTION": "You can hear a water dragon's roar even from inside the ship. Is this howl meant to get rid of those who disturb the souls of the dead crew members?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_413_DESCRIPTION": "As you try to escape the ghost ship to investigate, a frigid swordsman appears before you, along with his sword techniques which can turn anything to ice.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_414_DESCRIPTION": "It seems you must leave Amdahl if you are to defeat Cardes, but before that you need to escape the ghost ship.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_41_DESCRIPTION": "This monster-packed forest just goes on forever. Everything's the same, seems like you're walking in circles...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_420_DESCRIPTION": "You stop in a field, surprised by a mysterious man who now blocks your path. There's no time to loiter, you need to shake your fear and push ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_421_DESCRIPTION": "On your way toward Amdahl Castle, an incredibly graceful figure appears before you. Vanquish it and move ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_422_DESCRIPTION": "You've come to a prairie covered in trees and shrubs, but what is that lurking in the shadows, seemingly ready to strike...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_423_DESCRIPTION": "Nearing a pond at the edge of the prairie, some Water Nymphs stand in your way as if they're protecting something. What could it be?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_424_DESCRIPTION": "On your way from the prairie, someone has been sent to block your path. Carefully proceed forward.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_42_DESCRIPTION": "It's said that bandits occupy this forest. They may be tough, but there's no way to avoid them.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_430_DESCRIPTION": "After parting with Karl and Seria you proceed through the mines. Making your way through the monster infested tunnels, you come across a decaying bridge.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_431_DESCRIPTION": "It seems the demon Graham who escaped from Mistral has shown up around here. Could this strong presence coming from ahead be him? Or maybe...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_432_DESCRIPTION": "Continuing through the mines, you occasionally here the sound of thunder. Whether it's natural or the roar of some thunder beast, surely you'll find out soon.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_433_DESCRIPTION": "The center of the mine is full of traps. Blades are also quickly flashing about. Eliminate those who stand in your way and advance!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_434_DESCRIPTION": "A sanctuary can be seen shining just beyond the mine. The exit seems to be within reach. All you have to do is defeat the enemies before you.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_720_DESCRIPTION": "Before you lies a frozen lake. It seems the only way to get to the beach on the other side is to cross over it. Be careful as you proceed forth.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_721_DESCRIPTION": "It is dry here as well, but for a different reason than it was up in the mountains. It's impossible to stand still in this cold. Could Lugina really be waiting here?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_722_DESCRIPTION": "Step after shaky step, you cross the surface of the frozen lake. Looking back, you realize you've made it exactly halfway. How long will the ice hold?",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_742_DESCRIPTION": "The trees here seem able to withstand exposure to lightning. However, in noticing this it seems you have become lost.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_743_DESCRIPTION": "A paralyzing presence inhabits the forest. You recognize this aura. It seems a warrior you've faced before awaits you once again.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_753_DESCRIPTION": "Continuing your search of the ruins, an overwhelming presence stops you in your tracks. Up ahead, a knight of the La Veda Republic lies in wait.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_754_DESCRIPTION": "Burnt houses, crumbling churches. There must've been many residents in a city as large as this. You can't help but hope that the victims have found peace.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_760_DESCRIPTION": "Now that you stand near the bridge it looks a lot bigger than it seamed from far away. You can see an ominous tower far in the distance, but could that be the end?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_761_DESCRIPTION": "Turning back, you see the ruins. Compared to that desolate yet pure place, the bridge is soaked in an ominous miasma. What could be waiting ahead?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_762_DESCRIPTION": "The closer you get to the tower, the more hightened your fear becomes. It's as if the tower itself was infused with some sort of evil energy.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_763_DESCRIPTION": "You've finally made it to the bridge's halfway point. As the enemies are growing stronger, it seems fighting through the second half will only be more difficult.",

		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_853_DESCRIPTION": "The stench of death wafts through the air from the deep darkness. Where could this cave lead? This darkness is really unsettling.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_854_DESCRIPTION": "A pungent rusty metal odor pours into your nose. It's the smell of blood! The exit ought to be near, but there's no doubt something dreadful is waiting ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_85_DESCRIPTION": "You're almost at the top. A mechanical deity, likely Maxwell's creation, awaits. The final battle for Mistral begins.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_860_DESCRIPTION": "Running alongside a white wall, you chase after the dragon that injured Tilith. Following its trail should lead you to where Karl is.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_861_DESCRIPTION": "There's a sturdy tower intricately built from white stones. From its appearance, it looks like it was built as a military fortress, but it feels creepy.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_862_DESCRIPTION": "Hurry up the ivory stone steps. Who knows what kind of traps Mare set up ahead. Aim for the top, and proceed calmly, but quickly.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_863_DESCRIPTION": "Is Karl all right? Just as Tilith said, there must be a reason why Karl is being kept alive, so his life shouldn't be in danger, but still...",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_864_DESCRIPTION": "The enemy's attacks have gotten stronger. Perhaps you're nearing the top. With this much resistance, it must mean that Karl is ahead!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_865_DESCRIPTION": "A sudden surge of blood curdling power seeping down from the floor above stops you in your tracks. Prepare yourself and head up to where your two foes await.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_866_DESCRIPTION": "The top level of the white tower. The dragon slowly turns its gaze to you, and lets out a deafening roar. You have to defeat it and save Karl!",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_900000_DESCRIPTION": "The strange musician and the girl who listened to him.<br>It seems their songs are helping the tree to grow.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_900001_DESCRIPTION": "The tree grows as if it was being fed by the instruments.<br>Could its branches reach to where the girl came from?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_900_DESCRIPTION": "The city is enormous, befitting the once prosperous capital of an empire. Though it's smaller than Randall, make sure you don't get lost.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_901_DESCRIPTION": "Every building in the city looks plain yet sturdy. The fact that they've survived the ravages of war is testament to their expert craftsmanship.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_902_DESCRIPTION": "Lugina told your enemies to do their worst, but they are fiercer than you anticipated. Their spirit of kinship and heroism permeates the air.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_903_DESCRIPTION": "You are still surprised that Lugina is cooperating in Karl's rescue. Though his words suggest otherwise, he isn't such a bad person.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_904_DESCRIPTION": "You have reached the opposite gate. Though there are no signs of Mare, you can sense a sinister heat approaching.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_90_DESCRIPTION": "There is a mountain range at the end of the Egor Plains where it is said an evil god who once destroyed several small nations slumbers.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_910_DESCRIPTION": "The beach is peppered with Lugina's footprints. He warned you not to follow him, but you have no choice. You proceed along the shoreline.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_911_DESCRIPTION": "The comfortable sea breeze is a perfect complement to the sun's strong rays. But you don't have time to enjoy it and must keep searching for where Karl is being held.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_912_DESCRIPTION": "Though walking along the shore reminds you of your time with Tilith back at Morgan, there is no time for reminiscing. Brace yourself and press ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_913_DESCRIPTION": "Unlike the weather, the sandy terrain is less than ideal for combat. Walking so far from the city has also exhausted you.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_914_DESCRIPTION": "As you approach the end of the beach, the sand turns to mud. If experience has taught you anything, something formidable should be waiting ahead.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_920_DESCRIPTION": "Mare the demon is a master of deception. Her last words may be a ruse. However, her next attack could be imminent.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_921_DESCRIPTION": "An exquisite view fills your eyes, of geological formations you have never seen. Use extra caution as you proceed.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_922_DESCRIPTION": "You cannot rely on Lugina against Mare's tricks. Though you want to preserve your energy for your solo fight, the enemies' attacks just get fiercer.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_923_DESCRIPTION": "You worry about Karl's safety in the hands of Mare. However, now is the time to hurry ahead, not to think ominous thoughts about your friend.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_924_DESCRIPTION": "The terrain here is not as rough. Perhaps this is where Mare will strike. Prepare yourself for her attack.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_930_DESCRIPTION": "Dark clouds drape the sky above, punctuated by incessant lightning that racks your nerves. You must sneak past carefully, ready for Mare's next attack.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_931_DESCRIPTION": "The placement of enemies is no accident. They were planted with great precision to wear you down, serving you up on a platter for Mare.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_932_DESCRIPTION": "The enemies' vicious attacks are taking their toll. However, this is hardly the place to catch your breath, for Karl's life is in your hands.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_933_DESCRIPTION": "Mare's strategy must be working exactly as planned. Almost completely worn out, you are practically a sitting duck for her.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_934_DESCRIPTION": "The ominous clouds begin to clear, a sign that you may have made it out of your crisis. Yet taking a break now would be most dangerous.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_940_DESCRIPTION": "Perhaps Mare is afraid of the power some humans wield. That would explain her incessant attempts to wear you down.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_941_DESCRIPTION": "The air wafting through the tomb seems fresh and clean. Judging by the inscriptions on the wall, this place dates back to the Agni Empire.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_942_DESCRIPTION": "Fighting your enemies here makes you feel like a tomb raider. There don't seem to be too many booby-traps set in the tomb, but be careful.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_943_DESCRIPTION": "Continuing this solo battle is both physically and emotionally taxing. Try not to worry about Karl, or you'll play right into Mare's hands.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_944_DESCRIPTION": "A salty breeze wafts through the tomb, hinting at where it extends. Perhaps Karl is being held there.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_950_DESCRIPTION": "Seria is as reckless as always. You worry about her wounds but can't stop now. You thank her for her impeccable timing and proceed onward.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_951_DESCRIPTION": "The cave connected to the tomb seems to extend even further below the sea. The damp air makes you shiver as it tickles the back of your neck.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_952_DESCRIPTION": "The cave is even darker than the pitch black seafloor above it. Because of this, creatures of the dark have free reign.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_953_DESCRIPTION": "The stench of death that fills the cave twists your imagination in an ominous way. However, you pray that Lugina is able to rescue Karl.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_954_DESCRIPTION": "Somehow, the cave exhibits signs of human civilization. Could there be manmade structures this far below the sea?",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_960_DESCRIPTION": "You must properly thank Lugina later for securing Karl's safety. Being Mare's prisoner must not have been a cakewalk.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_961_DESCRIPTION": "Your exhaustion from the journey to rescue Karl has worn off. Perhaps the strong human bond between you that Mare loves to mock has its benefits.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_962_DESCRIPTION": "The shrine at the bottom of the ocean has a confusing, unearthly aura. The fact that Lugina was able to find Karl here is impressive.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_963_DESCRIPTION": "Rescuing Karl surely threw a wrench into Mare's plans. If you can attack her head-on and avoid her trickery, you have quite a fighting chance.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_964_DESCRIPTION": "The enemy attacks increase further in ferocity. But their primitive, brute force approach is evidence that you are hot on Mare's tail.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_965_DESCRIPTION": "You have reached the innermost area of the shrine. You will have to defeat the remaining enemies here before you flush Mare out, but do not worry: you are not alone.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_966_DESCRIPTION": "At last you have found Mare in a room at the back of the altar. Show her that she is no match for the human bond you share with your friends.",
		"MST_DUNGEONS_MISSION_970_DESCRIPTION": "It is said a ghastly spirit is sealed away deep within this gloomy dungeon home to dark secrets left from the Agni Empire."
