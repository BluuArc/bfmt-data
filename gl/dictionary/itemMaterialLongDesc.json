		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10000_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A plant that typically inhabits every area of Elgaia. It has been used in various medicines since ancient times. It can be found in many places, including forests. Synthesizing with it is so simple that even novices can easily handle it. As it is the foundation of recovery-type medicines, one can never have enough.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10001_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A plant native to northern Elgaia. It's more effective than Green Grass, but it's also hard to cultivate and thus not very common. It's used in making High Cures, but as it's hard to synthesize, only the most experienced can deal with it. It's native to Grand Gaia, and has been found in the Morgan region.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10002_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Though previously only talked about in ancient manuscripts as a legendary holy grass, it has recently been confirmed to be growing beyond Lucius' Gate. It's extremely potent and its use requires caution, as if too much is given it can lead to poultry delusion syndrome, wherein the user believes they are a bird.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10003_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A red grass infused with strengthening properties, it grows naturally in Elgaia and is thought to be generally easy to obtain. It's also very easy to synthesize, so even novice Summoners can work with it. Depending on the materials it's combined with, it can be used to create defense and attack strengthening items.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10004_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A bud from a certain type of tree that rarely blooms fully, and often transforms into branch colored grass. Most of these trees grow to be grass, but they all have the same qualities regardless of what kind of tree they bloom from. Its true nature is unknown, but it is believed to be a type of fungus or parasitic plant that serves as a catalyst for magical ingredients. Thus, if one comes across it, it is best to collect it.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10005_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A leaf that grows from the feet of the sparkling demon Arstallie. Found around Arstallie's dominions, this beautiful leaf's pink hue remains vibrant for quite a long time, making it a very popular decoration for clothes and armor. However, since all the vegetation that the demon Arstallie comes in contact with withers away, it is speculated that the nutrients of such vegetation are absorbed by the demon to give this leaf its particular beauty.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10006_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The core of the mysterious carnivorous plant known as the Queen Sipla. The sharp fangs at the corolla of this terrifying plant have devoured many a man, but the core within it is more difficult to acquire still. Being the organ that collects all of the Queen Sipla's necessary nutrients, its value is quite high and is often used to concoct secret medicinal formulas, as well as strengthening weapons and armor.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10007_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The dark purple vines that envelop Mordlim. They are self-aware, despite being plants, and have been seen to act on their own in concert with Mordlim's will. Owing to the otherworldly sap contained within the plant, humans caught by the vines find themselves disabled by unfathomable terror. Many scholars use these vines, which regenerate no matter how often they are cut, as materials for researching otherworldly technologies.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10100_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A feather from a migratory bird called Theo. It effectively defends against various status effects. These feathers have viable resistances for a number of special environments. Its feathers can be found in the Mistral region, the area through which it passes during its molting season.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10101_LONGDESCRIPTION": "There are many Elgaian tales of a harpy that lives a very short life due to it being wholly made from poison. Lynn was thought to be imaginary, but has recently been confirmed to exist in Grand Gaia. Lynn Feathers have been found in Morgan and St. Lamia, and, just as told in folk tales, are composed of countless poisons.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10102_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Rhau feathers were valued as good material for making equipment due to their flexibility and hardness, but the Rhau was over hunted and ended up going extinct in Elgaia. After Lucius' Gate was opened, however, it was confirmed to exist in Grand Gaia, albeit still rare. There have been many recent sightings near the Morgan coast.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10103_LONGDESCRIPTION": "These decorative feathers grow on the top of the head of the Saku, a bird that can speak human languages. These feathers are extremely rare since only one can be taken from each bird. Experiments using them are extremely limited, and due to their scarcity hardly any research has been done on them.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10104_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The appearance of the Yomi bird is said to foretell misfortune. Since its feathers hold a magical power, they can grant special effects when used as materials in weapons and armor. It's very valuable, rarely being seen in Elgaia, however it has been spotted near the Nocturnal Forest in the Morgan region of Grand Gaia.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10105_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Heth, said to be the mother of all birds, is thought to have looked the same way since before even the gods who created the world were born. It is highly resistant to changes in environment, which is said to be because it has already achieved its most advanced state. It is said to inhabit all parts of Amdahl, so obtaining these feathers isn't very difficult.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10106_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A feather from the Musa, a bird said to be loved by the gods. They're known for their light pink color and for their loving voices. Musa feathers were highly prized by people with refined tastes, and were hunted to the point that they could no longer be found in the wild. They are rarely ever seen in Grand Gaia, but bird lovers were happy to find feathers in Encervis, proof that a small number of them had survived.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10107_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A feather from the Rhoa, a bird said to bring good fortune to those who see it. However, since it has also been told that when the Rhoa flies away it takes with it the good fortune that it had brought originally, it is often argued as to whether Rhoa is actually good or evil. Unfortunately, because there are so few sightings in Elgaia it has yet to be further investigated. ",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10108_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Muvs are black birds known to migrate in flocks among other powerful monsters and demons. Seen as scavengers that bring bad omens, their feathers are detested and have little value among common people who do not even consider it as a useful material. However, when used in a concoction only known to the Demon Slayers, it is said to be able to refine highly powerful magical catalysts.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10109_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The day that the first emperor of the region of Agni was crowned, a seph bird came to visit the palace. This bird had purple feathers with red spots, and was quite common in the Agni region, but the bird that visited the palace that day had red feathers that seemed ablaze. It is said that the people took this as a sign of the gods' blessing upon the emperor, and from that day hailed the seph bird as an auspicious creature.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10110_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The Riff, a butterfly known for its striking beauty, has been affected by the long conflict with the gods to the point that it has become a rarity. However, these butterflies were said to be abundant in groups during the times when the first Summoner was crossing Grand Gaia. This feather is said to have the power to bring good fortune, but since it is such a delicate material, proper technique is required to use it. ",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10111_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The ominous Zeta bird is always challenging beasts stronger than itself, thus earning itself the nickname \"the fighting bird.\" The courageous way of life of this particular bird has always been admired by warriors and heroes since ancient times, serving as a great adornment for many national symbols and family crests. Both the tenacity and gentleness found in its feathers can be used as valuable items for creating weaponry, but there are some adventurers who choose to wear the Zeta Feather by itself as a symbol of bravery.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10112_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Known as the \"calamity bird,\" the ugly appearance of the Kuu has symbolized misfortune since the ancient times. Recent research has discovered that this bird had a hidden, yet small magical effect on the people and the beasts surrounding its environment. Its feathers, which reflect such type of magic, are often used as materials to create special and fatal weapons.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10113_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Summoners who have seen Yugreia first-hand claim that its wings are ablaze. However, recent surveys suggest that what covers the wings is not fire, but a type of liquid-like solid that shines brightly while maintaining its extremely hot temperature. After a certain Summoner took this Item home, the heat that it was still producing was used to create many different types of tools.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10114_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A blazing feather from Yugreia's wings that although appears to be on fire, is actually coated in a strange solid substance. These feathers that Yugreia sheds in battle, which tend to break into tiny pieces when the demon is defeated, can only be obtained in intact clumps with a great deal of luck. This material is indispensable when studying the composition of Solid Flames.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10115_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A red feather that grows from the wings on the back of the sparkling demon Arstallie. Since Arstallie never sheds its feathers, the only way to obtain this material is by defeating the demon it is attached to. Composed mostly of scorching fire, these feathers are rumored to never burn out. For this reason they are held in high regard as a material for crafting weapons, though the feather itself can be sold for a hefty price as well.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10116_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Due to their constant exposure to powerful magic, Barion's wings have an extremely strong affinity for sorcery. This precious material excited researchers due to its ability to act as a virtually lossless conductor for magic. However, as it constitutes a portion of a demon's body, this item is very difficult to gather in large numbers. Thus, it is believed that it will not bring about the technological revolution some researchers hoped for.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10117_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A feather of a Grylus, an extraordinarily rare species of bird found only in Menon. The rarely-spotted Grylus inhabits ruins, and is therefore known as the \"Gray Phantom.\" It's been found that the bird is aligned with both Light and Dark Elements, an unusual quality thought to be caused by Menon's peculiar environment; the land where Karna Masta was sealed, which is home to the resting bodies of countless demons.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10118_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A feather from one of Heresy Demon Kalon's wings. Kalon's wings are able to absorb the demonic essence of Ishgria and convert it to spiritual power. These feathers are said to be black originally, but turn a deep scarlet and eventually fall out as this property is used. The fallen feathers hold immense, sinister magical power, and those who touch them carelessly are said to have their spirits contaminated by evil on the spot.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10200_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The Don tree is found throughout much of Elgaia, and its nuts are an effective antitoxin. These nuts are very bitter and must be synthesized with Blue Drops. The trees are native to Grand Gaia and can be found in areas near Lucius' Gate, such as the Cave of Flames or the Magutagal Wetlands.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10201_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The nut of the perennial Koka tree that increases the aggression of the consumer. Since it's difficult to control its effects if eaten as is, it is usually synthesized into Atk Potions. It's very rare in Elgaia, but has been confirmed to exist all over Grand Gaia, mainly in the areas around the Mistral and Morgan regions.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10202_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The fruit from the perennial Buru plant, native to all Elgaia. It's sweet and can be eaten as is. However, it's often used in synthesis due to its high fortification effect when synthesized with Blue Drops. It can also be found in regions such as the Egor Snowfield and the Forest of Beasts in Grand Gaia.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10203_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The nut of the annual Hoku plant which increases self-defense instinct when eaten. It's not very common in Elgaia, but is native to a wide area in Grand Gaia, mainly in the areas around Mistral and Morgan. Its use in Def Potions has increased its demand, but its strong smell makes harvesting them unpopular.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10204_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The fruit of the Suzu tree, a conifer, native to northern Elgaia. For ages these nuts have been known to soothe the spirit and were used as charms. Later research found that the nut has a spiritually stabilizing component,  prompting  a search for new uses. It can be found in areas like the Demon's Nest in the Mistral region.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10205_LONGDESCRIPTION": "This nut is from the broad-leaved Bara tree. It can heal temporary paralysis, but its hard to eat as is because of how spicy it is. Due to this, however, its powdered form is extremely popular among spice lovers. It can be found wild in many areas around the Mistral region, such as the Remains of Mirza.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10206_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A healer once called the Holy Doctor of Grand Gaia used this nut to make various types of medicine, but his knowledge was lost after the great war. When thrown into a fire, this nut releases a lot of smoke as it melts. The smoke is highly poisonous, and can cause loss of consciousness and hallucinations when intoxicated by it. It seems like the Holy Doctor somehow managed to make medicine out of this poisonous smoke.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10207_LONGDESCRIPTION": "On the back of the shining dragon Laguna Rex grow countless organs with a pointed shape. The real function of these parts is unknown, but it is believed that they are connected to its terrifying life force. Furthermore, in the case that the red nuts which grow between these arborescent organs are withering, it means that the dragon is weakened. When in good health, these nuts tend to expand.  ",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10208_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Called the nut of the backwoods, it is a mysterious and rare organ from the shining dragon Laguna Rex, which can be seen releasing light in various occasions. This organ, which shines just as brightly as a scale of the dragon itself, has completely different properties than the regular nut of the backwoods. Detailed information about it will come from further research, but according to the hypothesis of a certain scholar, a surplus of vitality might be accumulated in this special nut.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10209_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The Meru-Meru fairy tree is a fearsome creature, but it is also undoubtedly a plant. The proof of this is in its thick foliage, the flowers that bloom from it, and the large fruit that it bears. When covered by the unusual hardness of this nut's shell, it doesn't have the usual poisonous or medical effect one would expect. For this reason, the pit of the nut is discarded, and many craftsmen place emphasis on the many beneficial uses of its hard shell instead.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10210_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A nut from the Meru-Meru tree that is said to take an incredible amount of years to ripen. When it matures, the shell of this nut is much stronger than that of a new nut, ready to be forged into a weapon right away. However, the tree that this nut grows from is a monster that has been in waiting for countless years. Special precautions must be taken to avoid an encounter with it when trying to collect this special nut.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10300_LONGDESCRIPTION": "These drops are from springs all over Elgaia and Grand Gaia. They're used for drinking and for healing. Soaking the ill or injured in this water is said to speed recovery. However, the effect is not immediate, so soldiers and Summoners often make Cures by synthesizing these drops with Green Grass.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10301_LONGDESCRIPTION": "These drops can be drawn from springs in Elgaia and Grand Gaia. As they are extremely sweet, they are highly valued in synthesis with harsh tasting things. They're also popular as a healthy sugar alternative. Still, as they are extremely sweet, only those with a serious sweet tooth can drink them straight.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10302_LONGDESCRIPTION": "These drops can be drawn from springs in the depths of the Morgan region or the mountains in the St. Lamia region. They're known to be slightly red. They're more effective than Green Drops, and more so when synthesized with Cures or Blue Grass. They're also well-known for making up hot springs.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10303_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Gold Drops pour out from springs in the rocky lands of Craster's Ravine, west of Elgaia. Their name comes from the legend that they can wash away a swords dullness and make it shine as if it were freshly tempered. The spring where these drops are found is used to treat and dilute the components of Michelia Grass because of their reactivity.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10304_LONGDESCRIPTION": "These rare drops are said to have fallen from the heavens, having been called forth by a monk's prayers. These light purple drops hold a great recovery effect, and the valuable Divine Light can be created with them and a High Cure. Rumor is that the spirit of the monk still carries them around St. Lamia.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10305_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Silver Drops pour out from a few springs located in the temple in Arlon, a sacred part of Elgaia. These springs are high in spiritual power, and it is said that the dead can be restored by their pure waters. Only the temple's high priest knows how to do this, but even diluted, this water is very powerful.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10306_LONGDESCRIPTION": "These drops come from a stream flowing from the Dragon's Cape at the north-east edge of Elgaia. Since many dragon fossils have been excavated at this cape, people have come to know the combination of these drops and dragon fossils as Hero Blood. This stream also grants incredible power to those who drink from it.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10307_LONGDESCRIPTION": "These rare drops are said to be the fallen tears of a goddess. It's said that the miraculous power hidden in these drops grant her divine protection to inanimate objects. There are no drops remaining in Elgaia, but powerful spirits and demons sealed away in Grand Gaia occasionally drop them.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10308_LONGDESCRIPTION": "These unique drops are distributed by the Summoners' Council. They are extremely effective in healing summoned spirits or monsters. When synthesized with Cures they can even revive fallen Units. Like other Honor type materials, despite their high demand, it's unknown where these come from.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10309_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Smoky-looking drops that release a putrid gas, occasionally found among special fungi clusters across Grand Gaia. They have the rare properties of sublimating into a gas upon impact and blocking out magic, and thusly are incredibly unstable. The Summoners' Hall has long since established a refinement technique and the Demon Slayers have been actively using said technique, though details of which have yet to be disclosed to the public.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10310_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The main reason why Van Lucy can't be said to be a mechanic doll from the underworld is because the blood of a god runs through its veins. Rather than being just a mechanical device, the structure it uses to move its body is closer to that of a living being. It resembles a god with muscles made from metal. There is also the possibility that it is just a god with an awkward appearance, and thus the Summoner's Council is conducting further research with the hopes of reproducing its godly powers.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10311_LONGDESCRIPTION": "There are many people who believe that Van Nader is not a mechanic doll from the underworld, using this as support for the idea that the gods dislike machinery. And though there are exceptions, the gods usually tend to reject anything that is not native to Grand Gaia. Many heroes that took part in the great war of the gods also came from, or had powers which originated from the underworld, so it is believed that there may be a connection between the two.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10312_LONGDESCRIPTION": "This water that seems to continually ooze out of Yugreia's body is speculated to be different from what it seems. It may look like the liquid is dropping from its body, when in fact the liquid is going back into the body as it flows. Similar to how humans breathe in air just after exhaling, it is believed this monster does the same with this liquid. However, since a live specimen can't be brought in for study, there is no way to prove this theory.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10313_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Legends on Vilanciel tell us that the aurora that shines in the night sky is a rift between worlds, and that it connects to the great sea on which the mother goddess lives. The Northstar Water that can be found in regions where the aurora is visible is said to be holy water that dripped in from that sea. The legends hold that drinking it can purify any corruption, and that plants watered with it will flourish in any environment.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10400_LONGDESCRIPTION": "This is a fundamental material easily obtained throughout Elgaia. Apprentice blacksmiths start their training with them. Since many Green Claws are required even when making difficult weapons, a smith can never have enough of them. It's said that all weapons come from the Green Claw.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10401_LONGDESCRIPTION": "This blue claw is found relatively often in the Kagan Desert in the Morgan region. It's known as a very hard and powerful material. It's necessary for  making high level weapons, so many search for them in Morgan as they're difficult to obtain in Elgaia. It's also said that the Holy Blade Evrix was made from it.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10402_LONGDESCRIPTION": "This rare red claw is found in the mountains around St. Lamia, such as the Volcano Eldent or Mt. Wistorea. They are well-known weapon materials. It's said that a renowned Sphere tempered with a Red Claw will gain a powerful effect. They can be found in Elgaia, but are much more common in St. Lamia.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10403_LONGDESCRIPTION": "An ancient fossil mined from a part of the Bricio Volcano in the eastern part of north Elgaia. It currently has no use other than being sold as a travel souvenir. However, in recent years rumors of a new refining method for it have spread, though the specifics of this method have been kept secret.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10404_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A fossil of an evil beast's claw, excavated from the Bariura mines in the Mistral region of Grand Gaia beyond Lucius' Gate. Many black magicians have identified an unearthly radiation coming from this fossil. Its uses still haven't been established, and research on it continues night and day.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10405_LONGDESCRIPTION": "These unique claws are distributed by the Summoners' Council. There are claws, fangs, bones, pelts, drops and eyes among the so-called Honor type materials, and each are used  in the creation of special Spheres and tools. However, where they come from is a complete mystery. Rumor has it they are debris from another world.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10406_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The claw of a huge monster. Owing to their extreme size, blacksmiths nowadays trade in fragments of these nails rather than whole specimens. A highly valued item across Grand Gaia, Giant Claws are only found in the deepest regions of Cordelica. It is rumored that the Giants once used them to create weapons.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10407_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A claw from a beast named after a creature from another world which shares its name with common demons because of their similar horns. One theory states that that this beast is from a subspecies of intelligent dragons who appear to enchant their own claws with a special kind of magic. Assuming one is powerful enough to access Amdahl, they are relatively easy to find in the area.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10408_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Rumor has it that, though not often, a gate to Hades appears in Grand Gaia. The Hades Claw is said to have come through it. Reapers in Hades use scythes made of this claw as it holds great magic. However, they are exceedingly rare as the beast is rarely seen. Processing one is also difficult as extreme heat is required.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10409_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The rigid claw of a ferocious beast that resides in the lands of Agni. These beasts were deemed highly dangerous as they brought harm to many citizens. The ancient emperor rewarded those who slayed the beasts, therefore hunting them became a custom for proving a knight's strength. It is said that the beast's claws could even cut through steel armor, and blacksmiths of the Agni Empire used it to fortify blades with them. However, details of the forging techniques they used are still highly confidential.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10410_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Reduhark has gone down in folklore as the god that brings forth the night and gives birth to the darkness. With strange body parts meant for flying that can barely be called wings, it is said that he lands without making a sound in the dead of the night, and slashes through human flesh. The eyes of this god that charges at humans always show his cold nature, and show no signs of anger or remorse. He gazes in silence at the red blood that drips from his claws.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10411_LONGDESCRIPTION": "It is said that whomever is injured by one of the thousands of claws that the god of destruction has will continue to see visions of his own demise. The death of a friend, the death of a loved one, a disastrous accident, or one's own limbs rotting away are just a few examples of the illusions that will take over one's mind and eat away at one's heart until death arrives. Thus, being surrounded by 100,000 forces during the great war of the gods was considered infinitely better than having to face the god of destruction, Mistzug.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10412_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Whoever dares to anger the god of destruction shall be cut down by these crimson red claws. It is said that when injured by the claws of this god, one shall suffer from visions of destruction until his spirit welcomes death, but these particular claws have a unique effect. While the injured person's life may be out of danger, he will gradually start losing the ability to think until his consciousness is completely lost, leaving behind the mere empty shell of a man.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10413_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Originating from an ice beast with a shell similar to that of a turtle, this material is attracting attention due to its dullness. Ice beasts use these claws to cross over frozen lakes and to climb cliffs, surpassing the shell when it comes to durability. Thought it is hard to construct anything out of this material, any armor made from it will maintain its efficiency for the same amount of time that some turtles are believed to live for hundreds of thousands of years.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10414_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The main reason why Van Lucy is suspected of being a machine is because a demon with almost the same exact shape exists. Some Demon Slayers who brought back with them a part of Van Lucy's muscles discovered that the two bodies were indeed made of two different metals. Though the metal is very similar to a very popular and widely known metal in Elgaia, it seems this is a godly metal that is still unknown to humans.  ",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10415_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The possibility of Van Nader being a machine is low, but there is no denying that there are some within the gods that have been granted powers from the underworld. It is now highly believed that this demon was born in the same fashion. If more of these machine-like demons were to be born, it would set back the research done in Grand Gaia. The Summoner's Council is trying to get to the bottom of this, and is working on a countermeasure that could be used if necessary.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10416_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The talon of a demon beast imprisoned in the underworld. This beast resembles the Cerberus that roam the Mistral region, but it is infinitely bigger and more ferocious, making it a much more dangerous opponent. Many believe the Cerberus of Mistral to be the less capable descendant of this ancient beast, having adapted to survive in that particular environment.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10417_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The talon of an otherworldly beast said to have a machine-like body. The existence of this creature has yet to be confirmed in Grand Gaia, though many pieces believed to be its body parts have been found in the rubble of the ruins in Atharva. Since this talon proved to be the most malleable of the pieces found, it has become widely used to create weapons and Items.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10418_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The durable claw of a thunder beast believed to have the ability to fry anything it scratches with a high electrical current. It is said that some Summoners bore the burning scars left by this claw on their armor to intimidate their enemies in battle, as it looked like they had suffered a direct hit and survived. However, the claws used as ingredients today seem to have the electricity extracted from them.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10419_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Amongst the many myths that survive today, there is one particular story which is quite interesting. There was once a man who committed an unavoidable sin he regretted, so he asked the gods to forgive him. And though he continued to pray, he could not erase the sin he had committed in the past. No matter how much he regretted what he had done, the past could not be changed. However, one god decided to answer the man's prayer. Legend has it that this god used its powerful fist to destroy the karma connected to the man's sin, freeing him from it.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10420_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Sharp enough to cut through steel, Grudkia's claw is feared by numerous warriors and adventurers. However, boasting of incredible durability, this claw is also ironically regarded as a valuable item for creating various types of armor. There are also those who choose not to use it as an ingredient, but instead as a medal of valor, adorning their breast plates and helmets with it instead.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10421_LONGDESCRIPTION": "An extremely rare material found in Ishgria's Lem region. Based on its shape, it is believed to be the claw of some creature, though no further details are known about it. However, light is able to penetrate the claw when it hits it at certain angles, so it is speculated that the creature it belongs to also possesses the ability to make itself transparent. Since this material is light weight but durable, it is highly sought after to make armor.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10422_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The claw of a massive earth dragon native to Estria. These earth dragons have undergone partial mineralization, and aside from the fact that they make their homes primarily in caverns deep underground, their life cycle is shrouded in mystery. Their fangs and claws are extremely hard and a substantial amount of energy can be extracted from them. One theory holds that these properties are due to the influence of the energy reserves that lie underground in Estria.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10423_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The multi-legged automatons on the other world of Bectas have massive claws roughly half the length of their bodies, and a habit of shredding anything that crosses their path. The Akras Summoners' Hall urges caution regarding these automatons. However, these claws are composed of a unique ore, and are gaining attention as new workable Materials.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10500_LONGDESCRIPTION": "This green fang can be found in the mountains of Elgaia and all over Mistral. The biggest fangs can be as large as a human head. They are dense and heavy, making them perfect for weapons such as axes. They've been one of the most heavily used materials since ancient times due to how easy they are to obtain and process.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10501_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The Blue Fang can be collected in the mountains around Elgaia and all over Mistral. The biggest fangs can be as large as a human head.

Once, when the beasts were chasing each other among the clouds, they fumbled into the domain of one of the gods.

Covered in black fur, it is said that this beast prided itself in its power, and had more trophies than it could hold. Its arrogance angered the gods, and thus it was stripped of its name and turned into a plant. Now known as the Purple Emperor flower, it is big, sharp, and stiff. It resembles the fang of a beast, giving it the name \"Purple Fang\" among the populace.",

Its true nature is still a mystery, but magic can be felt emanating from collected samples, and thus it seems to be meant for magical purposes.

This animal's jaw strength is such that it often chips off, or breaks its own fangs as it masticates its prey. For this reason it is quite common to run into this creature's broken teeth, and are thus often used as materials to create weapons. However, there are many who invade this beast's territory unprepared and end up losing their lives in the process. Therefore, great caution is needed when searching for this particular material.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10513_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A fang continuously surrounded by a bit of electricity. The fang was believed to belong to a creature that resembles a giraffe in its mature state, but since the beast has lower intelligence than a giraffe and its stature is also smaller, this claim is disputed by many scholars. This beast's fang has the ability to absorb electricity, so it is often used as a material to create weapons. However, since it also has the power to call lightning, its magical properties are used for various rituals, and to set up traps as well.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10514_LONGDESCRIPTION": "In Bariura there is an ancient legend that tells of an invisible monster. It was thought to be a mythical creature at first, but after the fangs of a creature not found anywhere in the area were discovered, many began to believe that the fangs belonged to the rumored invisible beast.

Its faint glow isn't strong enough to light up the darkness, but it does emit magic of a unique wavelength together with the light it does produce.

Though the heart may stop beating, the mysterious heat that emanates from it is still unfathomable.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10616_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The origin of the shining dragon's name comes from the extent that the single horn on its forehead glows, and from its first-class rate ferocity. Many scholars debated the reason as to why its horn glows, but after one of these dragons was vanquished, a shining orb was found inside the dragon's skull that solved the mystery. However, the reason why this pearl-like jewel glows itself is still unknown, and its high value as a material makes research difficult.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10617_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Van Lucy, a new heterogeneous demon which has appeared only recently. Its appearance is strikingly like a machine, which had lead many to believe that it was a weapon made by the gods.

		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10620_LONGDESCRIPTION": "If one browses through various myths, one will find that Nalda Delia's eyes were originally meant for protecting all living beings above the ground. However, the countless follies that humans repeated time and time again incited the wrath of the ember god, and these eyes started devoting themselves to guarding against crimes. Acting as karma, legend states that the ember god will punish those who sin according to their crimes. ",

		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10623_LONGDESCRIPTION": "It is said that within the many speckles that run through the god of destruction's body lies the power to make those who see them go insane with visions of enemies all around them.

According to the testimony of a Summoner that fought Balmedia first-hand, its tail was completely ablaze.

This treasure stumbled upon purely by chance may be the key to Balmedia's ability to transform its tail into fire. ",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10628_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A jewel the size of a fist said to grow within Grudkia's body. Regarded for its extraordinary beauty, it is considered a valuable ingredient used to forge high quality armor.

		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10629_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Yugreia is a demon known for possessing the opposing properties of both water and fire. Often resorting to illusions in order to move about, the existence of this jewel was confirmed when Yugreia finally showed its true form.

It is said that with enough power, this item makes it possible to observe the entire world. However, even among Ishgria's demons, almost none have been able to use this power to its full extent. Since it was created from unknown materials with otherworldly techniques, it is difficult to acquire more than one.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10632_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A transparent piece of Beiorg's body which shines. This item, which lights up even when severed from its original source, is believed to be a crucial part of Beiorg's restorative systems.

However, if a wing were to be cut off, it immediately produces darkness that coagulates wherever it lands, perhaps making it impossible to flee from this demon. Being an extremely rare material, whoever wants to get his hands on a full wing from this demon will have to take him down in his entirety.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10713_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The fire clad dragon's temperature is unusually high. The temperature of the scales that its skin is covered in can cause severe burns on the frail skin of a human in a split second.

Once some of the members of the Demon Slayers took this pelt home to examine it, they rubbed steel against it, and accidentally ended up sharpening the steel.

According to newly collected data, the crystallized shell of this creature has the ability of sensing magical powers, though no demonstrations of this have been given as of yet.",

In short, this crystallized skin holds different elemental properties depending on its color.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10717_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Edelma's title of \"fire eating dragon\" is not a simple metaphor. More shocking than anything, it will set forests on fire and eat trees ablaze, as well as climb volcanoes to drink the lava that spews from them. Thus, the scales of this fire eating dragon do not burn, but rather have a great resistance against fire, making them an invaluable material. Though it has many uses, recently this material has been in high demand to construct fire proof houses.",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10718_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Though from the turtle-like shell of an ice beast, this soft pelt is considered a very valuable material. No matter how much it is stretched, the pelt will not break. It also handles temperature changes very well, so it is a very efficient material for making armor.

This pelt doesn't come from a particular animal, but is instead a combination of multiple animal pelts fused together, born from the development of new technology. Originally, special pelts where required to perform certain incantations and exorcisms, but since it seems that this synthetic pelt can be used for a large number of those rituals, many sorcerers and dark magicians use it. ",
		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10722_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Ancient Bariuran folklore tells of a beast which was invisible. The reason for its invisibility was believed to be its possible ability to mirror its environment, or perhaps the ability to refract light using water vapor.

		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10724_LONGDESCRIPTION": "According to the account of a Summoner who fought Balmedia, the hairs on its mane stood on end thanks to the high voltage electricity that ran through it. However, the pelt that he managed to bring back from his battle did not have such properties. Detailed studies are yet to be performed, but it is speculated that the mane turned into thunder itself, rather than the electricity being an added property. Not much is known about this particular Item, but many hope it will prove useful for future inventions.",

		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10726_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Bark from the Great Fairy Tree which has been shed and regenerated over many, many years. According to the research of a certain botanist, it was discovered that the bark never actually came unstuck from the tree. Remaining in that state for what seems like an eternity, it is believed that this bark is not made of actual wood, but that its rigidness points to it being some type of armor instead. This particular sort of bark is much stronger than the usual one found from Fairy Trees, and thus great caution is advised when in search of this material.",

		"MST_ITEMS_MATERIAL_10734_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Red-green silken thread believed to be spun by the phantom spiders that inhabit the demon Mordlim's body.
