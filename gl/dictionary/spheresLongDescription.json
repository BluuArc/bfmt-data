Their fall is said to have led to the blooming of flowers in the desert, and even the purification of toxic lakes. Thereafter the king sent his men to every region in the land to investigate this phenomenon. They found what was apparently a fraction of one of the fallen stars, and its composition and shape were made of minerals unknown to the region.

However, ironically many swordsmen fought over it due to its reputation, and in the end, Sorgel sealed the Holy Blade to prevent a war over it.",
		"MST_SPHERES_30002_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Sorgel, the famed swordsmith, had forged countless brilliant swords, but none of them could protect his family when the gods attacked. His misery and fury towards the gods led to the birth of a god-slaying magic sword. The cursed Beast Blade exudes an icy aura that can send even the most powerful of gods to the netherworld.",
		"MST_SPHERES_30003_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The swordsmith Sorgel went through great pains to forge this precious blade. Strengthened sword in hand, he went after a powerful dragon that had hidden itself deep within the mountains.

		"MST_SPHERES_30004_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Swordsmith Zergel knew that the god that rules over all blacksmiths was in the gods' army headquarters, and just like when he stole his master's techniques by simply watching him in his young age, he sneaked into the place to take a peek at god's techniques. But even when the blacksmith god with a single covered eye noticed Zergel's intrusion, Zergel just forced a smile and showed him his smithing techniques. After barely escaping with his life, Zergel returned with a sword he had forged himself.  It had the power to slay both man and god.",
		"MST_SPHERES_30005_LONGDESCRIPTION": "Swordsmith Zergel, who had stolen the techniques of the blacksmith god, began to create divine swords one after the other. One day while working, he found the first sword he had ever forged in the back of his shop. Seeing the half-finished, novice sword he had made in his youth, he decided to go back to his origins and forge the sword anew with the techniques he had learned from the god.

		"MST_SPHERES_30006_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The blades that the sword smith Zergel used to create during his search towards innovative techniques were usually always well balanced and effective.

Some gods that heard of the duel looked forward to the event by trying to guess the victor.

Having learned of this, a blacksmith god declared such an act as unfair, and thus forged a shining sword for the other warrior to wield.",
		"MST_SPHERES_30100_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A standard shield used by soldiers of the Titan race. Tailored for the Titans, the size and weight of it is extraordinary. Though normal humans aren't able to hold it, its thick armor is said to be able to block even powerful attacks from the Titans, and would prove to be a valuable asset on the battlefield if only one could actually wield it. Records of the Giant Shield can be found in the historical archives of the Titan race.",

However, a cavalry leader with a shield on his hand recognized the assassin, and without a moment to lose, shot the assassin to death full of arrows, and the assassination attempt was thwarted.

		"MST_SPHERES_30106_LONGDESCRIPTION": "This ultimate shield is said to be the last and the best masterpiece of a legendary armor craftsman.

The gods explained that it was against nature to revive the deceased, so the man broke every taboo possible, seeking hidden knowledge to pursue his goal. It was then when he finally created the Godly Staff, which instead of bringing forth miracles, was only capable of awakening a person's hidden life force. Perhaps a miracle is not something that humans can bring forth after all. ",

However, the person the gods decided to bestow the staff upon happened to be none other than the emperor of the nation of Bariura, an empire known throughout history for its long obsession with war. Regardless of whether the successors of the emperor lived for a short or long time after him, they all waged war incessantly either way.

Nonetheless, one of the techniques created during this process gave birth to this incredibly hard and rare armor.",
		"MST_SPHERES_30305_LONGDESCRIPTION": "In mythical times, there was once a beast whose fur grew harder depending on the radiance of the moonlight. The fur would be hardest on nights when the moon was full, making it impermeable to damage from weapons made by the gods themselves.

It is said that from then on the general sought to improve the armor's abilities.",
		"MST_SPHERES_30308_LONGDESCRIPTION": "There was once a high ranking god who became interested in the things that humans produced. Though imperfect, he admired the effort they put into their trades and decided to fool around by trying to make a piece of armor himself.

One could say that this amazing piece or armor was born from the boredom of a god.",
		"MST_SPHERES_30400_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A battle axe that belonged to Mariudeth who was said to be the strongest man in the Agni Empire. This axe is so large that a regular human can't even lift it.

The power to unlock its wielder's hidden potential and fulfill their deepest desires.

		"MST_SPHERES_31000_LONGDESCRIPTION": "There is a unique set of swords known as katanas which were brought to Grand Gaia by a visitor from another world, having since gained the attention of swordsmen everywhere. The sharpest among these, one with Muramasa engraved in it, is so sharp even a fly that landed on its edge would be sliced in two. It's said that the Muramasa is bewitchingly powerful, urging its wielder to fight.",
		"MST_SPHERES_31001_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A large sword said to be made in the image of a blade that emerged from the tail of an eight-headed dragon spoken of in otherworldly tales. Though it doesn't compare to the original, it still boasts powerful abilities. However, much like any reproduction it lacks stamina and cannot be used for long periods of time. There are some who even say that it is not a mere reproduction, and was in fact built as a catalyst which draws the actual force from which it was created from the other world.",
		"MST_SPHERES_31002_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A sword modeled after one spoken of in otherworldly tales that was said to have vanquished a mythical eight-headed dragon. Oddly enough, however, it was made in Grand Gaia, and its shape is long and double-edged. This suggests that maybe someone came from the otherworld and produced swords there.

In praising his loyalty and wisdom, the King of the Sama Kingdom bestowed him with a new shield, upon which he requested that Darvahnshel give it a name. Appreciative of not just how sturdy it looked but also how beautiful it was, without hesitation he gave it the name of his wife. ",
		"MST_SPHERES_31102_LONGDESCRIPTION": "There was a goddess who, though cruel and short tempered, cherished humans. This shield holds a great amount of power, but, not unlike the goddess's temper, its effective time period is short. Also according to the goddess, if one bearing the shield should perish in battle, they would return once again manifested in pain and agony. One has no choice but to test this theory, as no one knows whether or not the goddess speaks the truth.",
		"MST_SPHERES_31200_LONGDESCRIPTION": "The Bariula Empire was destroyed by the gods, leaving behind its legacy of being home to its enchanted weapons and armor. The Death Scythe was among these pieces, with the special ability to draw from its wielder's strength in times of danger, using it to boost its power.

		"MST_SPHERES_31600_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A dagger with a button hidden in its hilt, which when pressed fills its blade with poison. Originally designed as a weapon for weaker swordsmen, its ease of use made it a popular choice of weapon among assasins as well. The user can freely change the type of poison embedded in it, thus veteran assasins often carry several Poison Shivs containing varied poisons.",
		"MST_SPHERES_31601_LONGDESCRIPTION": "An improved version of the short bladed Poison Shiv. With increased power split up into two blades, it is now easier to deal a venomous strike on one's opponent. However, as a result of requiring both hands to wield, this weapon considerably restricts its wielder otherwise. The ability to wield these knives freely is the sign of a skilled assassin. ",
		"MST_SPHERES_31602_LONGDESCRIPTION": "A concealed lethal weapon made from poisonous miasma. It is most commonly found within a particular flower, hence the origin of its name.
