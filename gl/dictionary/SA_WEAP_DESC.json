		"MST_SU_ARM_10_DESC": "A magical sword created by the Akras Summoners' Hall specifically for the use of Summoners. Forged by the most capable craftsmen of Randall, it was designed to provide a balance between its offensive and defensive properties. Its light weight and easy maneuverability makes it the perfect weapon for novices, proving especially reliable in dangerous missions. Furthermore, its ability to develop new skills through continuous usage makes it a beloved weapon for many experienced warriors as well.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_20_DESC": "A magical spear created by the Akras Summoners' Hall specifically for the use of Summoners. The Brave Spear has more reach than a sword, and thus focuses more on the defensive aspect of battle. For this reason, it is a weapon favored by many novices. Some experience is required to wield it properly, but continuous use of this weapon leads to the development of various attack techniques. And whoever manages to master these, will most likely reign supreme on the battlefield.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_30_DESC": "A war axe discovered in Michele's Sepulcher, located in Bectas. This axe has seen the centuries go by, and was well cared for by the mechanical creatures that guarded it during that time. It has also been confirmed to have magical abilities that prevent it from losing its attack power. Its great weight makes it difficult to wield, and leaves a lot to be desired as far as defense. Nevertheless, there are those who find themselves attracted to its overwhelming destructive power regardless."
