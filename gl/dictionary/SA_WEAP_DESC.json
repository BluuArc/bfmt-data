		"": "Sabit hebat indah ini ditemukan di Penjara Beast Ilahi. Desain ningrat yang menggangu ini sepertinya merujuk pada sepasang saudari. Dongeng tentang dua saudari ini memakai sabit setan yang tertinggal bermandikan darah adalah salah satu yang paling mewakili dalam sejarah Kekaisaran Bariura. Sangat mudah digunakan meski dari bentuknya yang tidak biasa, bilah sihirnya cukup tajam untuk menembus kekosongan itu sendiri. Pasti mengirim musuh Pemanggil yang mengganggu untuk mendapatkan ganjarannya.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_100_DESC": "A blade masterfully made by a skilled smith. This blade is a prototype of later works the smith made to slay the Mystical Fox, and enhances its wielder's attacks. Many swordmasters have wielded this blade over time, but even to this day it retains the precise sharp edge it had on the day it was forged.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_10_DESC": "A magical sword created by the Akras Summoners' Hall specifically for the use of Summoners. Forged by the most capable craftsmen of Randall, it was designed to provide a balance between its offensive and defensive properties. Its light weight and easy maneuverability makes it the perfect weapon for novices, proving especially reliable in dangerous missions. Furthermore, its ability to develop new skills through continuous usage makes it a beloved weapon for many experienced warriors as well.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_110_DESC": "A staff that once belonged to a renowned saint from ancient times. The saint traveled all over the land healing countless people, and offering her support against the invading forces of the God Army as well. Although the warriors on her side did everything they could to protect her, she ultimately gave her life for the cause after infusing her beloved staff with the last of her power. Those who inherited the staff revered it as the saint herself, and enshrined it for centuries as a symbol of her faith.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_120_DESC": "A set of short swords discovered in an otherworldly temple. An investigation of the temple has revealed that these weapons were sacred ceremonial items used in festival dance rites. The dancers for these performances were also masters of these blades, able to overwhelm enemies with an instantaneous flurry of strikes. Indeed, it was the dancers' great skill that originally led to the blades becoming objects of worship. In turn, this allowed the dancers to develop countless beautiful yet deadly dance-like techniques.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_130_DESC": "A massive hammer made to destroy even immense enchanted puppets in a single strike. Its creators originally emphasized this destructive power to the detriment of all other traits, making it both too large and heavy to carry with ease. However, after improvements from numerous master smiths, it is now shaped and sized for human use. It still strikes with a force that can crush an enchanted puppet's armor with ease, and looks so intimidating that some foes will flee at the mere sight of it.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_140_DESC": "A longsword discovered in the remains of an enchanted puppet at the Demolished Tomb in Rokkzalm. It initially seemed to be a simple piece of scrap metal, but began to glow and change form when a certain Summoner grasped it. The Summoner was first enshrouded in light, then bedecked in resplendent attire. Later research revealed that the sword is made of an unknown metal which creates physical manifestations of the wielder's courage. It seems unlikely that a wielder of this blade can fall, so long as he or she maintains a grip on the weapon. At least, so long as the wielder's courage holds out, that is...",
		"MST_SU_ARM_150_DESC": "A battleaxe found sealed in the land of Ishgria, a world home to throngs of powerful demons. Its power increases relative to its wielder's fighting spirit, and scholars believe that at full power it can strike with enough force to readily slay both gods and demons alike. Legends from Ishgria tell us that the axe was sealed away for many years, its existence concealed by a demon who feared it might disrupt the balance of power in Ishgria and invite more needless battles.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_160_DESC": "Long ago, a brutal demon dragon appeared in another world. Made uneasy by its presence, the gods used a special technique to forge a battle lance. After a long fight they subjugated the evil dragon, thereby protecting the order of the land. The lance then disappeared and for many years its whereabouts were unknown, until recently when it was discovered in Valdroar. No one knows how it came to be left there, but none of the lance's hidden power had been lost, and it is said to bestow the power to defeat dragons upon whoever takes it in their hands.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_170_DESC": "A sword discovered in the Resurrection Furnace of Valdroar, it constantly radiates a sacred power, and the weak are said to be annihilated just by approaching it. According to one theory, the Resurrection Furnace was built by disciples of the Pious Emperor in order to resurrect him, and this sword was specially prepared by them to bestow upon their master on his return. It is thought to have sufficient power to destroy even the gods, but finding someone with sufficient power to wield such a weapon has proven difficult.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_180_DESC": "Twin blades forged by an otherworldly god of war said to have slain 100 other deities. The weapons appear to be comprised of hilts alone when not in use, and emit blades of light when needed for battle. These blades resonate with the wielder's fighting spirit, and can cleave through armor like paper in the right hands. The blades also seem to grow over chains of consecutive attacks, and are said to have towered skyward in the hands of their original creator.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_190_DESC": "A holy sword kept heavily guarded in the vaults of the Summoners' Hall. It is said to have been made using the absolute entirety of the power available to a certain group of gods, humans, and demons who longed for a fair and just world. Most hold that a single individual with this blade would be enough to turn the tide of any battle, and its divine blade has yet to sustain a single blemish.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_20_DESC": "A magical spear created by the Akras Summoners' Hall specifically for the use of Summoners. The Brave Spear has more reach than a sword, and thus focuses more on the defensive aspect of battle. For this reason, it is a weapon favored by many novices. Some experience is required to wield it properly, but continuous use of this weapon leads to the development of various attack techniques. And whoever manages to master these, will most likely reign supreme on the battlefield.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_30_DESC": "A war axe discovered in Michele's Sepulcher, located in Bectas. This axe has seen the centuries go by, and was well cared for by the mechanical creatures that guarded it during that time. It has also been confirmed to have magical abilities that prevent it from losing its attack power. Its great weight makes it difficult to wield, and leaves a lot to be desired as far as defense. Nevertheless, there are those who find themselves attracted to its overwhelming destructive power regardless.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_40_DESC": "Pistols discovered on Subzero Road. Imbued with divine protection that allows use with either hand and allows for novices to move skillfully. Their muzzle velocity also increases in accordance with experience using the weapons, as do impact force and accuracy. As such, they have given rise to an increase in gun-based martial arts. These incorporate maneuvers such as ricochets off of walls and rocks, and moves that defeat entire groups of enemies while seemingly entering close combat.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_50_DESC": "A great sword found embedded in a stone in the Mystical Wolf's Lair in Vilanciel. It is thought to have been used when the Emperor of Bariura first faced the divine wolf. Using it is more like striking with a lump of metal than cutting, and even carrying it is a struggle for normal people. However, claims that nothing can withstand a single blow from a warrior with this blade and the skill and strength to use it are not exaggerated.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_60_DESC": "This beautiful great scythe was found in the Divine Beast's Prison, and its unsettling, noble design almost seems to convey its reverence for a certain pair of sisters. The tales of these two sisters using a demonic scythe who left battlefields drenched in blood are among the most representative in the Bariura Empire's history. It is unbelievably easy to use despite what one would imagine from its unorthodox shape, and its magical blade is sharp enough to cut through nothingness itself. It is sure to send the Summoner's more bothersome foes to their just rewards.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_7011_DESC": "A legendary robe bestowed upon true master Summoners by the Summoners' Hall. The legends tell us that it holds the souls of the Six Heroes who inspired hope in humanity during the war with the gods. However, the robe's power cannot be used without immense effort by the wearer, and it has never been utilized at its full potential to date. The legends hold that the being able to fully utilize this robe will also be able to summon the courage to overcome any trial. Just as the Six Heroes did, such a Summoner would lead humanity into the light of hope.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_70_DESC": "A whip made from the hide of a furious dragon from another world. Not only can it be used to strike foes, but its sharp tip can simultaneously inflict fatal damage upon any target. Its great flexibility also allows the wielder to hit any target regardless of the distance between the two. Although Summoners all have different styles of fighting, this is not really the easiest weapon for novices to use, and thus it is only recommended for capable and experienced Summoners.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_8010_DESC": "Originally the Fireseal, one of the eight \"Sacred Treasures\". It was stolen by Sol Badguy from the Sacred Order of Holy Knights and modified. In addition to being both a blunt weapon and a firearm, it is able to amplify its wielder's flame powers. The weapon possessed by the Summoner is but a copy created from spare parts by Sol on a whim. It is inferior to the original, but boasts considerable firepower that is unsurpassed by normal weapons. ",
		"MST_SU_ARM_80_DESC": "A bow made by a craftsman visiting Elgaia from another world. It has great range due to its composite construction. Though beautiful, its arrows have the terrifying ability destroy enemies from the inside out. They also devour the energy of any foes they hit, boosting the archer's energy in the process during battle.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_9020_DESC": "A sacred scripture handed out to a select few Summoners. It contains the words of a matron goddess who rules over bountiful harvests and prosperity, and is said to have the power to ward off misfortune. Although there was once an era when clergy bearing these scriptures brought prosperity across the land, this descended into disorder due to improper use of the scriptures' powers. As a result, the Summoners' Hall now controls the remaining texts. Currently, the Summoners' Hall requires expertise in all fields of knowledge as a prerequisite for possession of a scripture.",
		"MST_SU_ARM_90_DESC": "Twin blades made from otherworldly ore. The metal holds magical energy, and they leave afterimages when swung. Striking before the images fade will deepen foes' wounds. Many warriors have sought to use these blades due to that advantage, however few have been able to master them due to the massive amounts of strength required to wield them."
