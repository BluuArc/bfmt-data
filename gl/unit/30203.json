		"description": "This subspecies of Metal King is said to hold within its large body a huge collection of information on the element of earth. Though members of the metal record species mostly go uninfluenced by the knowledge they hold, there is a theory that states that Earth Kings may be comparing themselves against the knowledge they hold inside them which causes them to speak unkindly. Though they express joy when complimented, they're quick to return by saying, \"You're still going to fuse me, right?\"",
