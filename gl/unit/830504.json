		"description": "Fang came from a noble family in the kingdom of Krung-go, a prosperous land hidden within the mists of the eastern seas of Grand Gaia. She never enjoyed life as a noble and had always rebelled against her parents' wishes, pursuing martial arts and hunting instead of court ethics. During a hunting trip one day, Fang met Fei, a hunter from a middle class family. Fei was well educated and was able to teach Fang not only hunting techniques, but also social ethics that she refused to learn in the palace. Thus, they grew close over time. While wandering the unexplored wilds one day, they were observed by Xie'Jing, Witch of the Abyss. The witch was taken to Fei's good looks and schemed to seduce him.  She then proceeded to abduct him, posing as Fang. When Fei interacted with her, he felt something amiss and kept questioning the imposter. When Xie'Jing finally revealed herself, she was angered by Fei's frantic threats to get Fang back. As a final resort, Xie'Jing put a curse on Fei and turned him into a heartless being that lived only to follow her every command. Before Xie'Jing got back, Fang managed to escape and saw what had happened. When she went back to the kingdom to get help, no one wanted to help her rescue Fei, stating that he was not of royal blood, and thus not worth the trouble. From that day onwards, Fang trained even harder each day, always on the look out for companions willing to help her in her rescue mission.",
