However, their empty tablets steal the sealed  techniques within other tablets, turning them into Elgif in the process. Though this outcome may sound like it reduces their numbers greatly, they seem to reproduce at a constant rate regardless. Unfortunately, however, neither the Emgif nor Elgif truly grasp how valuable their tablets truly are.",
