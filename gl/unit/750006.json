Once the rainbow dissipates, the creature magically disappears with it.<br><br>Like the other Crystal Gods, Rainbow variants systemize and store all manners of elemental knowledge, though at a capacity that is beyond the ken of their lesser cousins. Legend holds that within these records lie the memories of aeons past, and if the creature so wished, it might even use this information to foretell the future.<br><br>As a lone Crystal God is already a rare sight, let alone even a small gathering of them, seeing a Rainbow Crystal is said to be a portent of great blessings and change.",
