A lonely sort, they are constantly seeking to bond with others and therefore fuse easily with their spirits. Their particular role is to create structure from formless matter. Once fused into others, they use this ability to give a permanent boost to the Rec of their hosts. Many are believed to reside inside Alpha Tree Altri, forming the source of the tree's healing power.",
