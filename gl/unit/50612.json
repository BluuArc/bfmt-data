Said to have been born from the combination of dozens of imps, Arton supervised his subordinates while they worked. Not only is he extremely wise, but as the almighty imp, it is speculated that he could be used as an all-purpose ingredient instead of fusing numerous other imps at once. However, capturing Arton is an extremely rare feat, and thus research on this subject has failed to advance any further.",
