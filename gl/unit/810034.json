		"description": "Once a budding plant, this bulb has harnessed the essence of fire by enduring the fires of battles and natural destruction. They glow red in the night, warm to the touch. Some travelers capture them for warmth before traversing the colder regions of Grand Gaia. It is said that its Scoville scale is so high that no normal man can consume it. Many who have tried have died of shock and blood burns. But to be able to consume and endure the blood burns of the Fire Bulb would push the body to incredible limits, greatly strengthening it.",
