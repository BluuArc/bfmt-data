		"description": "Once budding plants, these bulbs which grow on the highest peaks of mountains above the clouds, embrace the purest of daylight, in time harnessing the essence of light within them. They shine with a soft bright glow. Adventurers often capture Light Bulbs as a light source to traverse in the night, and or to explore the underworld of caverns and mountains. Some ladies seek them for consumption, as rumors say that their properties help with the fair glow of the skin.",
