Though gender doesn't exist in the metal record species of which Metal Kings are included, it is said that there are many Water Kings which talk and act more feminine than others. It was once said that because of this they were most often encountered by men, though there's been a lot of fuss since it came to light that this may not be so. However, despite this some still believe the rumors.",
