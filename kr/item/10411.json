		"lore": "It is said that whomever is injured by one of the thousands of claws that the god of destruction has will continue to see visions of his own demise. The death of a friend, the death of a loved one, a disastrous accident, or one's own limbs rotting away are just a few examples of the illusions that will take over one's mind and eat away at one's heart until death arrives. Thus, being surrounded by 100,000 forces during the great war of the gods was considered infinitely better than having to face the god of destruction, Mistzug."
