		"lore": "A nut from the Meru-Meru tree that is said to take an incredible amount of years to ripen. When it matures, the shell of this nut is much stronger than that of a new nut, ready to be forged into a weapon right away. However, the tree that this nut grows from is a monster that has been in waiting for countless years. Special precautions must be taken to avoid an encounter with it when trying to collect this special nut."
