	"lore": "An internal organ believed to be Van Nader's heart. Similar to Van Nader's other organs, this one's structure is very complex and made of an unknown type of metal, which makes it really difficult to think of Van Nader as a truly living being. This heart has been known to explode in several cases when brought back from the battlefield, and thus it requires a great deal of care when being handled. The reason for its sudden explosion remains unknown, which has only served to further slow down its analysis.",
