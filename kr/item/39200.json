Both bangles hide great restorative powers within them, and using them in combination with healing magic can cure any type of wound in an instant. The Gold Bangle seems to be more effective than the White Bangle, but since the goddess gave the Gold Bangle away to someone else, she treasured the White Bangle she had left very much in its stead.
