		"lore": "There was a maiden who once went searching for a flower said to bloom way up high on a tower where the gods supposedly lived. Believing in the legends she heard in her village, she climbed the tower in search of the flower thought to unlock powers hidden within people. The villagers worried about for her safety, but no one knew her reason for finding the flower. She wished to become stronger than any one of them."
