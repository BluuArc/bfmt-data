		"lore": "A vine from the mysterious carnivorous plant known as the Queen Sipla. Extremely sturdy and boasting of abnormal elasticity, this vine cannot be cut by a regular blade. It is said that many of the adventurers that have fallen prey to the Queen Sipla are first robbed of their ability to move by these vines before they are eaten. This material is not only treasured for its role in making hefty arms, but also for its use in making daily household products."
