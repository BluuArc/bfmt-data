		"lore": "There are many people who believe that Van Nader is not a mechanic doll from the underworld, using this as support for the idea that the gods dislike machinery. And though there are exceptions, the gods usually tend to reject anything that is not native to Grand Gaia. Many heroes that took part in the great war of the gods also came from, or had powers which originated from the underworld, so it is believed that there may be a connection between the two."
