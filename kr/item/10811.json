		"lore": "This electricity generating organ from Bruzebia is very difficult to collect intact. This organ that produces electricity is very delicate, and can be easily broken when struck. There are countless Summoners who do not use their full power against the beast when trying to collect this material, but wound it deeply instead. However, it is said that for a skilled Demon Slayer collecting this material should be a fairly easy task."
