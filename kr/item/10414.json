		"lore": "The main reason why Van Lucy is suspected of being a machine is because a demon with almost the same exact shape exists. Some Demon Slayers who brought back with them a part of Van Lucy's muscles discovered that the two bodies were indeed made of two different metals. Though the metal is very similar to a very popular and widely known metal in Elgaia, it seems this is a godly metal that is still unknown to humans.  "
