The Holy Blade is said to have been crafted using the Sorgel's most refined techniques, therefore it was said to possess a power pure enough to vanquish evil. However, ironically many swordsmen fought over it due to its reputation, and in the end, Sorgel sealed the Holy Blade to prevent a war over it."
