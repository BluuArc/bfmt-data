However, it does not allow its user to teleport freely, only towards a preset portal and is often used by the Demon Slayers as a means of rapid travel. Although it isn't perfect, the process of creating this potion which produces highly refined magic is only disclosed to a few Summoners and its distribution to the public is strictly restricted."
