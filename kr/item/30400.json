		"lore": "A battle axe that belonged to Mariudeth who was said to be the strongest man in the Agni Empire. This axe is so large that a regular human can't even lift it. However, it's said that when Mariudeth swung the axe, he could slice even a Titan in two. After Mariudeth's death, magicians examined the axe but found no trace of magic, proving it to be just a huge axe."
