Most of them are entrusted with punishing sinners, but to praise those who have shown remarkable meritorious service, they present them with this great Angel Sword. Each Angel Sword has its own special features, and bear the names of the Angels themselves. However, there is no mention in any record of an Angel by the name of Zeliel, for which this particular sword was named."
