		"lore": "A glowing bug commonly found in the lands of Agni. It glows when night falls, seeming to adapt to the waxing and waning of the moon. In the Agni Empire, it is adored as a brave bug that would fight alongside a warrior's spirit, thus it is often seen as a motif engraved in weapons. On the other hand, it is disliked by rivaling countries of the empire as it reminds them of the powerful knights of Agni."
