		"lore": "A very rare stone found in Celgrad. Though it shines in six beautiful colors it houses a terrifying amount of power, and the slightest shock it suffers could cause it to explode. Because of this, the utmost care is required when handling the stone, though unfathomable power can be obtained when managing to process it correctly. It is rumored that the origin of this stone is connected to the power released by a certain group of demons."
