		"lore": "Reduhark has gone down in folklore as the god that brings forth the night and uses the shadows of the light to breathe life into the darkness. However, there is no other information in Elgaia that can be found concerning this god. Reduhark, a demon who has strange wing-like organs, swoops in silently in the dead of the night. His eyes do not always reflect the negative emotions of cruelty and resentment he feels."
