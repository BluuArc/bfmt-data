However, a knight who saw the reverence of an otherworldly god as blasphemous destroyed the temple it was housed in, and offered the treasure to the La Veda Republic. After this incident there are no records stating that the pearl was ever moved, but later on when the last commander of the knights opened the safe it was kept in, the pearl is said to have been missing.",
