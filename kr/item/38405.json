		"lore": "A blade rumored to have torn open the heavens of Grand Gaia long ago. Legend claims that countless demons came pouring out of the opening in the sky, leading some to believe that this blade marked the origin of demons. Because of its infamy, the blade was sought after during the great war with the gods, leaving records behind which state that humans meant to wield it at the time. However, whether this is true or not still remains a mystery."
