		"lore": "There is a large beast with a short horn on its nose and an armor-like pelt known as a mammoth. When tanned, its pelt becomes resistant to heat and bacteria, and has increased insulation. These attributes make it very helpful when used to create special magical equipment. It is said that mammoth hunters even use special tools when hunting them so not to harm their pelts."
