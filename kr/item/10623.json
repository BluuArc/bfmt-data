		"lore": "It is said that within the many speckles that run through the god of destruction's body lies the power to make those who see them go insane with visions of enemies all around them. For this reason it is thought that though Mistzug was at the front lines during the great war of the gods, he rarely ever fought in hand to hand combat. The human armed forces were destroying each other instead."
