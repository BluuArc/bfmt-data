		"lore": "A strong piece of armor forged by the otherworldly technique expert Garnan, from the Atharva Republic, under the orders of general Pell Intyz whilst in an expedition together. When Pell tried on the armor he was delighted to find out that his vitality had been greatly increased, but was disappointed that Garnan was unable to improve the armor's actual defense. It is said that from then on the general sought to improve the armor's abilities."
