		"lore": "The wings of Reduhark, which are endowed with elasticity, originate from a hard bone to which they are attached to. It had been a mystery as to how the structure of these black wings made the demon float, but a report has surfaced that claims this bone might be used as an intermediary organ that converts magic. The Demon Researchers from the Summoners' Council are hoping for a brave Summoner to prove the validity of this report. "
