		"lore": "Swordsmith Zergel knew that the god that rules over all blacksmiths was in the gods' army headquarters, and just like when he stole his master's techniques by simply watching him in his young age, he sneaked into the place to take a peek at god's techniques. But even when the blacksmith god with a single covered eye noticed Zergel's intrusion, Zergel just forced a smile and showed him his smithing techniques. After barely escaping with his life, Zergel returned with a sword he had forged himself.  It had the power to slay both man and god."
