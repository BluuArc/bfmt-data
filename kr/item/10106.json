		"lore": "A feather from the Musa, a bird said to be loved by the gods. They're known for their light pink color and for their loving voices. Musa feathers were highly prized by people with refined tastes, and were hunted to the point that they could no longer be found in the wild. They are rarely ever seen in Grand Gaia, but bird lovers were happy to find feathers in Encervis, proof that a small number of them had survived."
