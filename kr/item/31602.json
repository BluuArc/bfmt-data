		"lore": "A concealed lethal weapon made from poisonous miasma. It is most commonly found within a particular flower, hence the origin of its name. This weapon which is not meant to incapacitate foes, but kill them, has a very potent effect. Therefore, when using it one must be very aware of their surroundings, taking such things as wind speed and direction in mind. Only the most skilled assassins can handle such a dangerous weapon."
