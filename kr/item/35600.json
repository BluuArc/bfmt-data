		"lore": "Long ago, there was a pikeman known as \"Grumes.\" He was especially proud of his spear which was able to steal blood from people. Fearing being injured by his spear, it is said that all who fought with him were defeated before they even threw a punch. Claiming victory after victory, Grumes was once quoted as saying, \"This is but an ordinary spear,\" though none who heard believed him. "
