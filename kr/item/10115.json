	"lore": "A red feather that grows from the wings on the back of the sparkling demon Arstallie. Since Arstallie never sheds its feathers, the only way to obtain this material is by defeating the demon it is attached to. Composed mostly of scorching fire, these feathers are rumored to never burn out. For this reason they are held in high regard as a material for crafting weapons, though the feather itself can be sold for a hefty price as well.",
