		"lore": "Swordsmith Zergel, who had stolen the techniques of the blacksmith god, began to create divine swords one after the other. One day while working, he found the first sword he had ever forged in the back of his shop. Seeing the half-finished, novice sword he had made in his youth, he decided to go back to his origins and forge the sword anew with the techniques he had learned from the god. This sword called Magnarave was the one that made Zergel's reputation, but it is said that he never parted with it while he still lived. "
