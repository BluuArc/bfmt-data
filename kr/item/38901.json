		"lore": "There is a myth that tells the story of a hero that descended to the underworld in order to find his deceased older sister. His attempt to revive her proved futile, but the hero brought back with him a lance. Those who were struck by this lance suffered from weakness, deep wounds, and numbness that subsequently lead to death. The hero was successful in many exploits thanks to this lance, but in the end was struck by it himself, causing his untimely death.  "
