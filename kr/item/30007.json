		"lore": "A sword born from the anguish the blacksmith Ekzerg felt after losing his beloved to an assault by the gods. Forged from materials found in a city which had been destroyed by the gods, some say that furious voices can be heard cursing the gods when holding the blade close to one's ears. The destructive power of this sword is such that it consumes a person's heart, filling it with fierce hatred."
