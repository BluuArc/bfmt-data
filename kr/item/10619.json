	"lore": "The souls of the people who have been slain by this god are trapped by him, refusing to let them die. Such is the legend left behind of the ember god, Nalda Delia. This demon's eyes full of resentment are said to bring about catastrophes, though there is no one alive that can confirm that this threat is real. However, in accordance with the legend, many Summoners place a powerful seal over this material and keep close guard over it.",
