		"lore": "There once was a girl who, in search of a flower said to bloom atop a tower inhabited by the gods in order to heal her sickly mother, departed on a treacherous journey. Moved by her bravery, upon climbing the tower a god presented her with a beautiful flower. As thankful as the girl was to the god, she had still signed into a contract. Once her mother was healed, she was to climb the tower once again to serve under the god."
