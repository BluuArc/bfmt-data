	"lore": "This ultimate shield is said to be the last and the best masterpiece of a legendary armor craftsman. Its true power was witnessed in the battlefield during the war against the Gods. It guarded its wielder effectively against everything, including the downpour of arrows from the gods, the sharpest spears that could pierce armor, and the fierce charge of powerful divine beasts. The durability of the shield impressed the gods in the battlefield so much that a blacksmith god purposely put himself in the front lines just to glance at it with his very own eyes.",
