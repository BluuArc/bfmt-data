		"lore": "A potion distributed by the Akras Summoners’ Hall. Unlike Revive, it not only restores an ally’s battle ability, but also their HP in full. In the past, there were some who were inversely injured by the potion when it was administered to them for its healing abilities while they were still conscious. For this reason, its usage is now strictly controlled by the Akras Summoners’ Hall."
