		"lore": "A healer once called the Holy Doctor of Grand Gaia used this nut to make various types of medicine, but his knowledge was lost after the great war. When thrown into a fire, this nut releases a lot of smoke as it melts. The smoke is highly poisonous, and can cause loss of consciousness and hallucinations when intoxicated by it. It seems like the Holy Doctor somehow managed to make medicine out of this poisonous smoke."
