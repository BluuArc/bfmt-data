		"lore": "A device that must be worn on both arms and feet. Shortly after putting it on, the body of the wearer is covered with protective armor, and a mirage of the wearer is projected onto the surroundings to confuse the enemy. Once the armor has covered the wearer's entire body, it is said to begin empowering the wearer's soul, boosting their fighting spirit. The origins of such a function remain a mystery, but it is believed that this device was created using very high level otherworldly techniques."
