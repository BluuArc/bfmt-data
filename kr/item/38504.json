		"lore": "There was once a feared Summoner who as a general took command of the front lines. He possessed a heavy, shiny shield that bore many scars of battle, which he used to take control over the battlefield. Though some may call his fighting style reckless, it is perhaps more correct to assume he was very confident in his guarding abilities. This shield that was tested time and again in combat still remains as efficient as ever."
