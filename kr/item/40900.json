		"lore": "In his younger days, an elder Summoner found this hat in the ruins of the gods, which has the power to relieve some of the burden as a Summoner. The real artifact is said to have fallen into a crater as the Summoner dodged an attack during a battle that took place by a volcano. The elder still regrets losing the hat so much that he made it a part of the Summoner's Hall uniform."
