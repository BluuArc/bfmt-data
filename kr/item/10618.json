		"lore": "Van Nader, a demon of a curious shape that appeared here very recently. Resembling a machine from another world, its appearance is exactly the same as that of the demon Van Lucy. Though there are rumors that it is a weapon made by the gods, there are scholars who refute this claim by reiterating that machines are not capable of using magic. This demon, who has not been mentioned in any myths, is still shrouded in mystery."
