		"lore": "A feather from the Rhoa, a bird said to bring good fortune to those who see it. However, since it has also been told that when the Rhoa flies away it takes with it the good fortune that it had brought originally, it is often argued as to whether Rhoa is actually good or evil. Unfortunately, because there are so few sightings in Elgaia it has yet to be further investigated. "
