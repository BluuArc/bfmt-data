		"lore": "A blazing feather from Yugreia's wings that although appears to be on fire, is actually coated in a strange solid substance. These feathers that Yugreia sheds in battle, which tend to break into tiny pieces when the demon is defeated, can only be obtained in intact clumps with a great deal of luck. This material is indispensable when studying the composition of Solid Flames."
