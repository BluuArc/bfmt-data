Records say the robe was knitted by the cleric Emeldia in order to change the mind of a man who attempted suicide. Those who wear the Holy Robe are spared from death, though not from their injuries, so they're forced to endure their self-inflicted pain uttil they eventually give up on the thought of dying."
