		"lore": "In a rare combination, these are two great swords joined together. This lance with two spearheads is said to have the power to open another dimension. The power absorbed through whatever is pierced by one end is said to be released from the other end, but it seems like a special kind of power is needed to activate this. When used normally, however, this weapon has dark magic that can also inflict poison, sickness, and curses upon its victims."
