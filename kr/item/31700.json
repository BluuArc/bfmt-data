		"lore": "A magic gun developed in the ancient Atalva Republilc, inspired by a gun belonging to a visitor from another world. Black magic was cast on it so that it inflicts the weak status on its victims. Originally designed for hunting down large demons, its functionality turned out to be effective on all species and thus was used in a wide range of situations. Its only flaw is how long it takes to make ammunition for it."
