		"lore": "The bone of a strange dotted animal from the Mirvana region. Wielding a considerable amount of power, it is considered an invaluable material, though the creature from which this bone comes from has not been witnessed as of recently, leading to the conclusion that it has become extinct. Since many bones have been found spread around the region, it is believed that this creature might've covered a vast portion of the land before its extinction. The reason for their demise, however, is still being researched."
