		"lore": "The nut of the annual Hoku plant which increases self-defense instinct when eaten. It's not very common in Elgaia, but is native to a wide area in Grand Gaia, mainly in the areas around Mistral and Morgan. Its use in Def Potions has increased its demand, but its strong smell makes harvesting them unpopular."
