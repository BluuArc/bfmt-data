		"lore": "The possibility of Van Nader being a machine is low, but there is no denying that there are some within the gods that have been granted powers from the underworld. It is now highly believed that this demon was born in the same fashion. If more of these machine-like demons were to be born, it would set back the research done in Grand Gaia. The Summoner's Council is trying to get to the bottom of this, and is working on a countermeasure that could be used if necessary."
