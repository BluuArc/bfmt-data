Once it rescued a gentle soldier, and again healed a knight of love. When it flutters its burning wings, its wick of life bursts into flames. Concealing a just heart in its chest, it wields a sword that detests sin in order to protect the flame of life, no matter how small it may be. Regardless of how many times it is struck to the ground, it continues to stand up again and again. "
