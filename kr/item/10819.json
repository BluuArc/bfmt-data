		"lore": "One of Jirayen's gigantic horns. Discovered by an ancient adventurer, the horn's properties were found much too dense to use as an ingredient for making arms, and was instead used as a respected symbol of power. However, proper techniques were developed later on that allowed for the item to retain its tough nature while serving as material to create various weapons."
