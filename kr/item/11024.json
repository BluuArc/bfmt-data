		"lore": "A rare and mythical mineral found in Aldahlia. Its name originates from the love the emperor of an ancient and prosperous empire felt for this stone. Being beautiful and easy to manufacture, the emperor collected it in large numbers to build a beautiful garden out of it. Ironically, his insistence in collecting this stone caused a shortage of it to occur. After the emperor's death, his beautiful garden was destroyed in order to mine this precious mineral."
