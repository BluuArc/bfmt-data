		"lore": "A legendary blacksmith was once fortunate enough to run into a star that had fallen to the earth. Forging it with a fire full of his strong intentions, the star regained its radiance once again. Reacting to a will that sought to save the people, the star would shine its light in order to prevent calamities from happening. The blacksmith included this star among his many masterpieces, later awarding it to a famous hero. Using this weapon even in the midst of the most wretched battles, it protected the hero and his comrades while continuously feeding the fire of hope in their hearts. "
