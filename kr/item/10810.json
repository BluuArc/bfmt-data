	"lore": "There is an epic poem written about a wolf that served as the companion of the goddess of darkness. It is written that the wolf died during a sisterly quarrel, which saddened the goddess, driving her to pledge her divine protection over all of the wolf's children. In truth, the descendants of this wolf seemed to have greatly prospered, but under the influence of the Four Fallen Gods' rule, these wolves don't inhabit any other regions outside of Agni.",
