Its powers help to unleash the full potential of its possessor, but no record of any owners besides Atro remain, causing speculation about the truth of this ability. Legends say the gods were the ones to bestow this holy sword upon others, but new research concerning blood lineage has been carried out since Atro had it in his possession.",
