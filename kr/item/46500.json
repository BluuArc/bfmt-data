Believed to have been left behind by a god from another world which was visiting Grand Gaia, whoever wields the blade is said to become possessed by that very god itself. Indeed, the blade has the ability to grant its master a ludicrous amount of power, though no mortal is able to withstand it for very long. Even so, its power should be enough to defeat any average enemy within no time at all.",
