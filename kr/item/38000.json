The completed demonic stone wasn't thought to be as powerful as the dreaded evil crystal, but it was destroyed anyway as it was seen as a threat to world peace. The researchers who created the stone all ended up dying strange mysterious deaths and it was rumored that their souls were taken by demons as a punishment for creating the demonic stone."
