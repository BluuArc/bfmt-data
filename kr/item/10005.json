		"lore": "A leaf that grows from the feet of the sparkling demon Arstallie. Found around Arstallie's dominions, this beautiful leaf's pink hue remains vibrant for quite a long time, making it a very popular decoration for clothes and armor. However, since all the vegetation that the demon Arstallie comes in contact with withers away, it is speculated that the nutrients of such vegetation are absorbed by the demon to give this leaf its particular beauty."
