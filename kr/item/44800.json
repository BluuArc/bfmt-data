This blade known as a \"Swordian,\" is a sentient sword imbued with the personality and memories of Dymlos, a once courageous warrior from another world. The power of Fire lives within this weapon, and grants its wielder an array of other foreign spells. However, the strength of the blade itself can be said to be made for hand-to-hand combat."
