		"lore": "This sword is said to have been granted to humans by the Sea Dragon King. There is no information concerning the owner of the sword, but only that whomever possessed it must have had an incredible amount of bravery that entrapped enemies in a net of fear. There is a popular theory that the Sea Dragon King peeled an inverted scale from its own body to create this blade, but since sea dragons are not fond of humans, it begs the question as to why their king would have done this. The origins of this blade are still being discussed today. "
