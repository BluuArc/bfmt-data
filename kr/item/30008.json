		"lore": "There was once a long dispute between two small countries which was to be decided by a duel between their two best warriors. Some gods that heard of the duel looked forward to the event by trying to guess the victor. However, one of the gods favored one of the warriors over the other, and so it bestowed a divine shield upon him. Having learned of this, a blacksmith god declared such an act as unfair, and thus forged a shining sword for the other warrior to wield."
