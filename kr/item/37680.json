		"lore": "Originating from another world, this hair ornament called a \"kanzashi\" is said to have belonged to a fearsome young lady who massacred her enemies as she danced. The beautiful flowers that adorn this luxurious hairpin make it a priceless object from both a monetary and artistic perspective. And although its previous owner never had a second thought about taking the lives of others, she took great care of this particular possession of hers. Drenched in blood countless of times, it acquired magical powers that give the wearer heightened senses on the battlefield."
