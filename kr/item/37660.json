Though it looks like a broadsword at first glance, it transforms into both armor and a great sword, separately, after it is offered a special prayer. Gathering its power from the forces of Mother Nature, equipping it apparently increases the wearer's vitality. No information is left concerning the creator of this item, but according to the legends which tell of its presumed last owner, some suppose it was a creature of free will.",
