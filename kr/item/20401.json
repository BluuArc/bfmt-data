		"lore": "A powerful strengthening potion distributed by the Akras Summoners' Hall. Those who drink it receive a great boost in Atk power for a short period of time. It is made by combining an Atk Potion with a Koka Nut. These materials are relatively easy to collect, but a certain degree of skill is necessary in combining them. There is a rumor that the stomach pain it causes those who drink it is even worse than that felt after drinking an Atk Potion."
