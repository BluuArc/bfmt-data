After the criminal was captured, he is said to have claimed to be the \"heir of Ragu Blaze's curse, along with his sword.\" To this day the relationship between these incidents and the curse of Ragu Blaze remains unclear, but records state that after the execution of the criminal, the blade he used for his crimes was sealed away for a very long time."
