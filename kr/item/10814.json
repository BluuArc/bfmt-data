		"lore": "A stone-like bone found underground. It produces powerful attributes when used in manufacturing, but is highly explosive if mishandled. Thanks to this, using it as a material requires a great deal of skill in fusion. It is said they form underground from the bones of Bozdells, and there are some who even believe new Bozdells are born from them."
