		"lore": "The pelt of a ferocious beast that resides in the lands of Agni. The extreme ferociousness of this beast led to them being ceremoniously hunted as a way to prove a knight's strength. The beast's pelt is covered with bristly hairs that provide excellent protection, but with improvisation by the best armor craftsmen in the Agni Empire, they've been transformed into beautiful yet functional armor of the highest quality. It's said that rulers of other countries have offered exorbitant amounts of gold in exchange for armor made from these pelts."
