		"lore": "The durable claw of a thunder beast believed to have the ability to fry anything it scratches with a high electrical current. It is said that some Summoners bore the burning scars left by this claw on their armor to intimidate their enemies in battle, as it looked like they had suffered a direct hit and survived. However, the claws used as ingredients today seem to have the electricity extracted from them."
