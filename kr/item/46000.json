		"lore": "There was once a girl who pledged her life to the gods, and fought against the human race. The girl is said to have resented the people who had made her mother suffer, and loved the gods that have saved her mother. The gods loved her in return, and gifted her with a new type of flower. Infused with divine knowledge, the flower gave the girl a new power once she held it in her hands--the power to hurt many people. Unfortunately, she remained forever unaware of how much her mother grieved to see her fight. "
