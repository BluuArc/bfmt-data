The King Shield Divatin was also one of those items, previously owned by a wise ruler before it was offered to a temple. To protect the people, as a king he continued to stand in the front lines to repel attacks, and it is said that his survival of over 100 battles and his incredible longevity was all thanks to the great divine protection of this shield."
