When exposed to sunlight, it shines as if another sun had descended from the heavens. When exposed to moonlight, it reflects all of the stars in the night sky. This shield admired for its beautiful traits never suffers any damage, no matter how strong the attack it receives. Some say it is proof of the supremacy of the gods.",
