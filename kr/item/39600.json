	"lore": "In an ancient empire, there was a general who was renowned around the world as a very devout man. He prayed to the goddess of protection day and night, and is said to have lived the lifestyle of a clergyman. When in battle, his soldiers believed that he had the divine protection of the goddess, and thus forgot their fatigue and fought till the bitter end. It is believed that he never actually received this divine protection, but that his fame as a pious man created for him a protection similar to the one he would have received from the goddess. ",
