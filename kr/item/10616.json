		"lore": "The origin of the shining dragon's name comes from the extent that the single horn on its forehead glows, and from its first-class rate ferocity. Many scholars debated the reason as to why its horn glows, but after one of these dragons was vanquished, a shining orb was found inside the dragon's skull that solved the mystery. However, the reason why this pearl-like jewel glows itself is still unknown, and its high value as a material makes research difficult."
