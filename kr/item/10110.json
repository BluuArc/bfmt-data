		"lore": "The Riff, a butterfly known for its striking beauty, has been affected by the long conflict with the gods to the point that it has become a rarity. However, these butterflies were said to be abundant in groups during the times when the first Summoner was crossing Grand Gaia. This feather is said to have the power to bring good fortune, but since it is such a delicate material, proper technique is required to use it. "
