		"lore": "A solid ore found hidden close to the pores where Yugreia releases its liquid from. It is believed that this may be the organ which secretes Yugreia's Tragedy Drops. However, excluding the fact that this Item holds great demonic power, everything else about it remains shrouded in mystery. Many scientists hope that once more research has been conducted, this item will be the key to developing technology never thought possible before, and thus are currently seeking to collect more of it."
