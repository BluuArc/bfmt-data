		"lore": "The fearful empress Lilly Matah, who left a bad reputation throughout history, had a daughter. When she came of age, her successor took the name of Lilly Laze, and was also known as a tyrant. She carried on with the slave war her mother had started, and had a crown made of forbidden evil jewels. The brutality of the warrior who was given this demonic crown is said to have increased whenever he was struck, leaving a stench of blood so powerful that it surpassed that of his ancestors long ago."
