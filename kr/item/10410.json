	"lore": "Reduhark has gone down in folklore as the god that brings forth the night and gives birth to the darkness. With strange body parts meant for flying that can barely be called wings, it is said that he lands without making a sound in the dead of the night, and slashes through human flesh. The eyes of this god that charges at humans always show his cold nature, and show no signs of anger or remorse. He gazes in silence at the red blood that drips from his claws.",
