It is said that once some Summoners tried to visit the store and there was a Metal God dressed in a blue and white striped uniform working inside. Stating that it wanted to try new experiences in order to grow, the Metal God receives his customers with a smile from ear to ear. Unfortunately, even though it has tried new things, its knowledge and skills don't seem to have improved.",
