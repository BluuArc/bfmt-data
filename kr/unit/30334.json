		"description": "An incarnation of the power of Earth from another world. Legend has it these beings are the key to unlocking powers greater than those of the gods. Once there were gods from another world who gathered too much live flora together. The flora then gained a will of its own, and set out on a rampage. However, it proved to be too strong to be controlled and finally sought to destroy even its own self. Today, the earth is home to lots of living creatures, allowing their souls to eventually grow into an sublimated state onto a higher plane. If one is able to control the power of a Mecha God, the power of limitless Earth may become theirs.",
