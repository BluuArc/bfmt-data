		"description": "The all-purpose store \"Lawson\" is rumored to have come from a loophole in the gate that leads to another world. Spreading all over Grand Gaia, it distributed information stating that it was in need of employees. It was then when the greedy and famous Burst Frog nominated itself for the job. With its red body covered by a blue and white striped uniform, it greets costumers with a smile and eye contact, bringing many Summoners to the store. However, since it spends most of the money it makes buying things from the same store, it never seems to have much left over.",
