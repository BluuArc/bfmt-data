Their names not only remain in the history of Grand Gaia, but in the history of Elgaia as well, casting a great shadow through the incidents that surround them. The night before the Elgaia Federation was to be established, an independence supporter is rumored to have exclaimed \"With this lance I can destroy the world.\" as if possessed. The lance was never seen or heard of again."
