	"lore": "Chief Noel of the Akras Summoners' Hall Research Lab developed this unique Sphere using a durable ore collected from the Vortex. Wielders' bodies emit a faint aura of heat on equipping this Sphere, and its use creates a strong sense of empathy between the wielder and their comrades. In doing so, it also heightens the bearer's restorative powers and induces a distinct sense of well-being when equipped. Given that the extent of this property's psychological impact is entirely unclear, Noel continues to hasten data collection efforts.",
