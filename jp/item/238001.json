It is thought that a god granted this precious chalice as a reward for people's good faith, and that when pious believers put their lips to it, they were able to gain the powers they wished for. Thus the people believed in the gods more and more, and the precious chalice gained more power in response to their faith. The sense of faith continued to accumulate in the precious chalice, until it eventually came to contain greater power than even the gods themselves."
