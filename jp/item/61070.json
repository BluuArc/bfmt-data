		"lore": "A Sphere held since the founding of the Akras Summoners' Hall. According to the Summoners who knew of its discovery, it holds the power to redefine all reality as we know it. However, the Summoners' Hall has yet to deliver any commentary on the subject. It is held under strict security on the orders of the Summoners of Old. Given that only a select few are even permitted to study it, one can surmise that the Sphere has incredible influence over individuals."
