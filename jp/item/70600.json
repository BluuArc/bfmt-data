		"lore": "Made by using Brown Grass, the light that this eye shines is amplified to cover a very long distance, making it a catalyst for magic that can very well be considered clairvoyance. The light that it shines has a particular purpose. It can penetrate any object, and stretch over any distance, reflecting off any strong spirits that it encounters. It is said that since this item came into use, Demon Slayers have been able to locate the dens of demons more quickly."
