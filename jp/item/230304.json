		"lore": "The sorceress Poliaf was in love. She loved a man that she only dreamed of, a skilled and affectionate healer. She used all forms of magic to search for a man just like him, but never succeeded in the end. Later on, however, a protective charm she created demonstrated surprising restorative effects. She interpreted this as a token of love from the man of her dreams, and is said to have never let it leave her grasp again."
