		"lore": "After creating whirling tides in the sea, the Azure Dragon Estoreit leaves a lot of Azure Spheres floating on the water's surface. Most of them disappear in a matter of seconds, but those that remain are objects which hold great power. The rarity of these spheres entices many people to search after them, but Estoreit drives away any humans who come near it with powerful windblasts, making them very difficult to obtain."
