		"lore": "There's a story about a lost star whose dust fell down from the heavens. The dust gradually grew dim as it sadly fluttered about. A blacksmith saw this, and, waving his hammer, told the light to return home. The stars that watched over the night sky sang and danced in harmony with the dancing hammer. Shining brightly, the lost star finally made its way back to the heavens, leaving behind fragments of dust as it went."
