		"lore": "This fascinating sword known for its power to command dragons came to existence after a beast sought to eat a dragon, leading it to transform into a blade when it exhausted its life force. It has been referred to as a sword in legends, but this unique object merges with the arm of its wielder. It is said that when the vitality of this blade's owner is completely full, the arm turned sword shines as if it held a will of its own, unleashing a supernatural dragon-like power."
