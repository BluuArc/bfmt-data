	"lore": "A Sphere made by incorporating a substance Noel discovered when developing the Frontier Gate. It stimulates the wielder's regenerative powers, and has the ability to heal wounds instantly. However, the substance used in its creation is poorly understood, and one theory holds that its effects are due to parasitic creatures present within the substance. Accordingly, only a few prototypes have been made, and the Sphere is not in mass production.",
