		"lore": "Once there was a bow maker who traveled to various countries in order to create more bows. Whilst climbing the mountain where the thunder god is said to have been deified, a strange man suddenly appeared and challenged him to a bow and arrow duel. After their fierce competition, the bow maker won by a very slight margin, but before he knew it the strange man had disappeared, leaving behind nothing but his bow. Having the power to store electricity, this bow is said to paralyze the enemies it pierces with its arrows."
