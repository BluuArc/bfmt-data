The talisman then passed hands to the one who killed him, and after outstanding achievements on another battlefield, they too lost their life. The next owner and the one after also died in battle after their many deeds won them acclaim. After countless warriors gave their lives for this talisman, it came to be said that the spirit of a war god dwelled within it.",
