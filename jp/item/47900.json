It is said that this gem originated from the power of the gods fighting in another land. Whoever possesses this treasure is said to be revitalized and empowered, as well as driven to fight as if another epic battle were on its way. The authenticity of such a treasure remains uncertain, but if its power is real, it could prove very useful when exploring new lands."
