		"lore": "A magical bow found in the great forest of the Principality of Vriksha. Passed down among pixies since ancient times, it holds the power to steal the souls of those it shoots. The pixies took humanity's side when the great war with the gods broke out, and are believed to have slain countless members of the God Army with this bow. It is also said to have been used for an even more destructive attack on the gods after the forest was burned at the hands of the God Army."
