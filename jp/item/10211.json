		"lore": "The fruit of a tree confirmed to grow in the wild in Rokkzalm. Difficult to harvest due to its incredibly thin skin which pops like the skin of a bubble on contact. When its skin pops, the fruit releases a gaseous chemical which interferes with the nervous system. This chemical is also a powerful intoxicant, and is said to drain all fighting spirit from those who inhale it. Research has also revealed that the chemical is addictive, leading to high-value trading in the fruit among profiteering merchants."
