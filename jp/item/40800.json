Earrings that mimicked the shape of this flower became very popular, ranging from cheap wooden pieces to those made out of precious jewels, such as rubies. However, among these was a single stud made of Evil Stone, an unlucky stone which brought about calamity, that got mixed in with the rest. The person who wears this stud is said to display great evil, and will continue cornering whomever that person has deemed an enemy."
