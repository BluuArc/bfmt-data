Rain or shine, he visited the temple every day, until one day, he received a staff from the heavens above. Waving the staff over his wife, Robel was able to slowly heal her of her affliction. After she fully recovered, Robel and his wife spent the rest of their lives traveling the world in search of others they could heal."
