		"lore": "Legends on Vilanciel tell us that the aurora that shines in the night sky is a rift between worlds, and that it connects to the great sea on which the mother goddess lives. The Northstar Water that can be found in regions where the aurora is visible is said to be holy water that dripped in from that sea. The legends hold that drinking it can purify any corruption, and that plants watered with it will flourish in any environment."
