		"lore": "A scale-shaped crystal that shines with a wide variety of colors depending on the light and the angle it is viewed from. In rare cases, they are found among the scales present on Barion's tail. While it is virtually identical, technically it is not actually a scale. Instead it is believed to be the calcified residue of immense magical power. The power within cannot be drawn out here; advanced processing work will likely be required."
