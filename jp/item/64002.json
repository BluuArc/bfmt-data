Any who takes hold of it is said to be able to display great strength beyond what would be considered their limits. Some believe that, were it wielded by a divine being, it could destroy many worlds in one fell swoop. Upon realizing the sword's destructive power, which far exceeded expectations, it's believed the gods decided to seal it away on a distant world known to no one."
