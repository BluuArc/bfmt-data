		"lore": "A mineral found in the body of Arkem, the Calamity from Darkness. Not so solid in nature, this particular mineral can suffer damage quite easily while still in Arkem's body. For this very reason it is quite difficult to obtain one in perfect condition, though obtaining fragments of the same is more plausible. When melted into a liquid state, this material can be used for coating arms and the such. Whatever is coated in this solution glows a faint red color and acquires slightly more strength than before."
