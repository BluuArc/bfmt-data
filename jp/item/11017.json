		"lore": "A crimson mineral ore extracted from the lands of Agni. It exists within the core of a rock eroded by the wind and rain, thus it looks like a lofty tower standing among the wilderness. When heated, its red color turns a bright crimson shade, but when cooled, it is said to become clear like a crystal. Due to its characteristic of changing forms through heating, it can be used in a multitude of ways and has been highly valued because of that since ancient times."
