		"lore": "During the great war with the gods, the great sage Vagarna created a technique intended to save humanity from certain doom. This technique would elevate human physical abilities to godlike levels and transform fighting spirit into raw strength. Human minds proved unsuited to godlike bodies, however, and stories tell us that all of the technique's users went mad. Although the strange tome Vagarna left after his death contains only fragments of this technique, current scholars believe that even those would grant power that far surpasses that of an ordinary human."
