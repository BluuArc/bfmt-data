		"lore": "A high-precision simulator Noel discovered while developing the Frontier Gate. It emits a unique form of light, and can project three-dimensional images. It can reproduce scenes of the past that are extremely realistic. Noel has applied this technology to several fields of study, and in doing so developed a unique scene to play. It is believed to heighten the will to fight in those who see it."
