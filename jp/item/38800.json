Knowing he had been sentenced to death, the man accepted the dagger bravely, and pierced it through his body. However, the man did not die, and lived for 40 years after the fact. It is said that throughout this time he continued to suffer all kinds of illnesses, including poison and other incurable diseases, as well as the hardship of various curses.",
