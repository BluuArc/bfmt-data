When it was first discovered, it was operating on its own as the ruler of a certain region until a group of Summoners destroyed it, finally disabling it. Akras Summoners' Hall then gathered the pieces left after the wreckage, and fashioned them into wearable armor. Not only did they improve on its original abilities, but they also managed to replicate its restorative qualities. This piece is said have been engraved with the words \"No. 4\" before it was altered."
