		"lore": "Long ago, there was once a clan that made its living via the dark arts. The stories tell us that this clan preferred to live peacefully, but was eventually drawn unwillingly into a conflict. In order to protect their village, the clan unsealed this book of holy scriptures. Using the techniques inscribed within it, they gained great physical power and vanquished their enemies. However, the clan of curse-workers vanished inexplicably soon after the battle was won, and their book of holy scriptures is said to have been lost along with them."
