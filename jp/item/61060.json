This Sphere is said to have been retrieved from the plane between life and death, though there are absolutely no details regarding the individual who handed it over to Summoners' Hall. However, it is known to rule over the existence of all beings in the world, allowing those who simply touch it to become one with the world itself. It is speculated to be the key behind the mystery of creation."
