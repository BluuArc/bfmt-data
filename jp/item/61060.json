		"lore": "A shield used by the Dragoon Bargus. It's said to be crafted from a dragon scale that was given to Bargus as a token of friendship when he met a dragon. The shield possesses the defensive strength of a dragon and likely wouldn't suffer even a scratch from the slash of a regular sword. After Bargus died, the Dragon Shield was put up in the Sama Kingdom Knight's Court."
