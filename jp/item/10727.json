	"lore": "A piece of Jirayen's jet black and scaly skin. With both its skin and scales made up of very rigid properties, this item was found very difficult to put into practical use. In ancient times some craftsmen tried to pin the skin onto boards in order to create shields, but nowadays proper methods have been developed to forge armor with it. Furthermore, when the scaly skin is used as it is without any alterations, it boasts of protective properties surpassing those of regular armor.",
