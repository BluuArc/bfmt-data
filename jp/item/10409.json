		"lore": "The rigid claw of a ferocious beast that resides in the lands of Agni. These beasts were deemed highly dangerous as they brought harm to many citizens. The ancient emperor rewarded those who slayed the beasts, therefore hunting them became a custom for proving a knight's strength. It is said that the beast's claws could even cut through steel armor, and blacksmiths of the Agni Empire used it to fortify blades with them. However, details of the forging techniques they used are still highly confidential."
