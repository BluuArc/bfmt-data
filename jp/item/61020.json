		"lore": "A protective charm believed to have been owned by an otherworldly sorceress. Legends state that within the charm resides the will of the war god the sorceress once commanded, and that it grants great power in response to the bearer's wishes, bearing the brunt of attacks its wearer receives to protect them if they encounter mortal danger. The sorceress is said to have driven off the apparitions that plagued her world and accomplished many great deeds as well."
