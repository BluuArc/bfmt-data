		"lore": "The hide of a great serpent which lives in the Zamburg region. While great serpents are few in number, they are called \"serpent dragons\" for their size, and are feared as extremely savage beasts. Beautiful silver scales cover parts of these snakes' bodies, though more than mere decoration, they are also an extremely hard and treasured material used for arms and armor. Accordingly, there is never a shortage of those who wish to challenge the serpents despite the danger they represent."
