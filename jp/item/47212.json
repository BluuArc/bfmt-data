It is said that the deity stored antithetical concepts such as the sacred and profane, order and chaos, and truth and falsehood within it, and amplified their conflicts in order to create impenetrable barriers against all interference. However, tales also tell us that using its power requires substantial strength of the part of the user, and that normal humans will be sucked into the gem and lost if they so much as touch it."
