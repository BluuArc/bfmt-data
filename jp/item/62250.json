The boy Arnugle was drafted into the military to protect his homeland, and hoped to die defending another person rather than harming his foes. Moved by his feelings, the goddess granted the boy these heavenly vestments. With their protection, Arnugle was able to capture the enemy commander alive without suffering a single wound or injuring another living being."
