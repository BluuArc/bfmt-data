Though less heavily armored than the Armored Soul, it features a crystal in its center which consists of the concentrated essence of the Divine Armor. This enhances its performance in all fields far beyond that of the Armored Soul. Its developer has stated that the loss of physical defense was a sacrifice required in order to heighten the Sealed God powers imbued in the piece."
