	"lore": "There are two sacred objects of legend in the La Veda Republic. One is the statue of a goddess, and the other is the statue of a god. Divine robes were fashioned after the one the goddess statue is wearing when the gods demanded it. Legend has it that when both statues wear the robe at the same time, their real powers are unleashed. However, the statue of the god was lost in fairly ancient battle with a demon, and thus the two statues have been unable to meet since then.",
