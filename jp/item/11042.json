		"lore": "A fragment of jewelry once worn by the demon Mora. Cut from a type of evil stone only produced in Ishgria, this sample is of considerable scientific value. While it appears to be a normal piece of jewelry, at night, it glows with a demonic indigo light that seems to protect the wearer. However, when a female researcher tried it on, the light burned her, suggesting it may physically hurt anyone who wears it."
