		"lore": "In the times of ancient Agni there lived a beast that was a carnivorous tyrant amongst all others. Covered in black fur, it is said that this beast prided itself in its power, and had more trophies than it could hold. Its arrogance angered the gods, and thus it was stripped of its name and turned into a plant. Now known as the Purple Emperor flower, it is big, sharp, and stiff. It resembles the fang of a beast, giving it the name \"Purple Fang\" among the populace."
