	"lore": "This red beast's bone is found in the St. Lamia region of Grand Gaia. It's smaller than other bone materials, but very hard. However, due to its uniqueness, it requires a high degree of skill to process. It's an interesting subject for researchers as documention only records how to use them in synthesis, saying nothing about the beast from which them come.",
