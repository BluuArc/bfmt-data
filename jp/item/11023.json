		"lore": "It's told that there was once a great general in Lanara who never lost a battle. In his final moments, the hero fastened himself to a large rock, and passed away peacefully. From that point on, the rock, which radiated his aura, found its powers being slowly whittled away as soldiers sought to share in the hero's fortune. The pieces of this rock which have been spread throughout the land are known as Ogre Shards."
