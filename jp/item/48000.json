It is one of the weapons passed down from generation to generation in Loch's family, which served Palmyna royalty as sword instructors. Though it was a very powerful bow to begin with, it is said that after Loch faced Cardes the Malevolent for the first time, its power reached new limits. The reason behind this is suspected to be the fact that Eshuon was drenched in the blood of the Fallen God during the battle. ",
