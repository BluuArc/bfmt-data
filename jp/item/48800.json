Said to turn its wielder's life force into strength, the blade shines in a blue hue as it grows sharper relative to its owner's vitality. This blade's history can be traced back to the great war in ancient times, having made its way from the hands of a sorcerer seeking utter destruction to the hands of the heroes who would protect the world from said villain."
