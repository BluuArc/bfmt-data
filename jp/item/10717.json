		"lore": "Edelma's title of \"fire eating dragon\" is not a simple metaphor. More shocking than anything, it will set forests on fire and eat trees ablaze, as well as climb volcanoes to drink the lava that spews from them. Thus, the scales of this fire eating dragon do not burn, but rather have a great resistance against fire, making them an invaluable material. Though it has many uses, recently this material has been in high demand to construct fire proof houses."
