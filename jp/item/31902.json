This weapon, which he referred to as the \"Dark Spear,\" may look like a regular spear, but the blade at its point is actually very finely serrated. Due to this, those injured by this spear would suffer of irregular pain and cuts very difficult to heal in nature. Most people who met the end of this weapon lost their lives in the process."
