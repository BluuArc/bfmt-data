Based on current observations, since the Four Fallen Gods have not formed a group of any kind, it would seem that he is acting on his own judgment. However, he doesn't share the same hatred towards humans that other gods do. Though he is indeed strong, he treats humans the same way one would exterminate an annoying fly.",
