		"lore": "A gem said to contain the sealed prowess of the gods. It is known for unleashing an immense burst of power when its user is at their peak mental state. When activated, the power it releases exceeds humanly possible levels, but once the burst is over, its user's powers return to normal levels until their mental state reaches a peak again. Many believe that the gem was created to demonstrate the great powers of the gods in order to increase the faith the people had in them."
