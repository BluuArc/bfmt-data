		"lore": "There was a soldier who was invited to the underworld while he still lived. He used dark magic to exterminate the dead bodies walking around, including their ring leader, and thus was summoned by the king of the underworld. The soldier felt somewhat uneasy fighting endless hordes of the unliving, but the armor given to him by the king of the underworld had magic powers hidden within it that gave the soldier limitless amount of strength, like an immortal being. This strength would remain with him until his task was completed."
