Surpassing the height of an ordinary man, even if this Demon Bow misses the vital points of an enemy, it will still cause their body to rot away. The only thing known about this man is that his whereabouts suddenly became unknown after he exacted his revenge. Only the cursed bow remained hence, giving birth to numerous tragedies one after the other.  "
