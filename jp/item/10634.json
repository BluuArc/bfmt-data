		"lore": "A crystallized form of the magical energy that constantly burned in the palms of Heresy Demon Kalon. It's thought that the energy could harmonize with the soul of anyone Kalon faced, allowing the demon to see into their destined future. In theory, this crystallized energy could control the fate of others, but activating this ability would require immense magical and psychological power, comparable to that of a god."
