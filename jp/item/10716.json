		"lore": "It has been confirmed that the skin of Granomus changes color depending on the many environments it chooses to live in. It was simply believed to be protective camouflage, but now many think that this is the result of Granomus sensing magic from its surroundings through its crystallized skin, and consequently adapting to the neighboring environment, including soil, minerals, ice, and plants. In short, this crystallized skin holds different elemental properties depending on its color."
