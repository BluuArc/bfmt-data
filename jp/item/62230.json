		"lore": "A firearm developed in the Imperial Research Lab during the dawn of the Elgaian era. It boasts substantial improvements over the great war-era model of magical machine gun it was based on, including improved magical conversion ratios for bullets, massive power amplification for opposing elemental attacks, and more. Although officials at the time believed this weapon would act as a foundation for Imperial rule in Elgaia, the design blueprints were stolen by its developer before mass production began. Unbelievably, reports claim that the weapon later fell into the hands of a band of outlaws."
