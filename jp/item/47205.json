Originally there was nothing special about the stone, until Lucana received a revelation from the gods that asked her to guide her people towards a new promised land. It is said that it was only after this event that the stone began emitting a mysterious light. Lucana took the glowing stone with her throughout her journey to the promised land, and its light served as a beacon of courage and hope to her people."
