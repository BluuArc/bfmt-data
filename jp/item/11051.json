		"lore": "This is the core of a demon once sealed in St. Creek. This piece acted to control the demon's life force and magical power. This was as shown when its loss at the hands of a certain Summoner left the demon unable to channel energy throughout its body. It is composed of a substance unknown in either Elgaia or any other known world, and full understanding of its properties will require additional research."
