It is said that when injured by the claws of this god, one shall suffer from visions of destruction until his spirit welcomes death, but these particular claws have a unique effect. While the injured person's life may be out of danger, he will gradually start losing the ability to think until his consciousness is completely lost, leaving behind the mere empty shell of a man.",
