		"lore": "Though from the turtle-like shell of an ice beast, this soft pelt is considered a very valuable material. No matter how much it is stretched, the pelt will not break. It also handles temperature changes very well, so it is a very efficient material for making armor. There are many Summoners who collect this pelt without knowing its true potential, but the difficulty it presents when trying to processes it causes blacksmiths to ignore it for fear that once the pelt has been damaged, it will become utterly useless.
