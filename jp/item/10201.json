		"lore": "The nut of the perennial Koka tree that increases the aggression of the consumer. Since it's difficult to control its effects if eaten as is, it is usually synthesized into Atk Potions. It's very rare in Elgaia, but has been confirmed to exist all over Grand Gaia, mainly in the areas around the Mistral and Morgan regions."
