		"lore": "This rare magical stone is found in the Morgan and St. Lamia regions of Grand Gaia. Its name comes from stories about it, saying it can create souls. It's not very hard and thus easy to process, but it's difficult to handle as things made from it are easily broken. In its raw form it often resembles a human face."
