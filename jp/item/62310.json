		"lore": "A talisman said to be enshrined at the top of a mountain near sacred territory. It is thought to have been influenced by the close proximity to the gods' powers for many years, and believed to offer various types of protection to the bearer. However, climbing to the top of the mountain where the talisman is enshrined is fraught with difficulty, and the majority of people are unable to go place enough trust in their companions to move forward and are forced to give up. It is said that only those who believe in the bond with their companions to the end can obtain the talisman."
