A wine made with a thick nectar drawn from sweet fruits as its distinguishing point, it was said to heal the minds and bodies of humans exhausted by their battles with the God Army. While the wine itself is not special, it is believed to gain special properties when poured by the tavern keeper, Luccia, which raises its value.
