With a blade as sharp as the fang of the Dragon King himself, it is believed to be wielded with the goal of eradicating whatever damage has been done to nature. It is still unclear as to whether this sword of legend was really seen by anyone, whether it was part of the god army, or whether it was owned by a hero who defied the deities during the battle against the gods."
