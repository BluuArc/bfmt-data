		"lore": "A fang from a golden beast. It is said one can feel its regality in the way it eyes its surroundings with its mane blowing in the wind. Despite its incredible size and magic ability, it often acts in defense of weaker beings despite the dog-eat-dog world it resides in. It is said that their golden fangs shine with all of the reverence and fear of the beasts."
