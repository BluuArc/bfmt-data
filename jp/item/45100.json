	"lore": "The story of an immortal king is carved upon this armor. According to the story, there was once a king who had a piece of armor made in order to avoid death. The king gained the immortality he was after, but losing all his loved ones drove him into a deep depression, and thus he made his way to the underworld to join them. However, even there the armor kept him from dying, prolonging his suffering even further. This story has been classified as a work of fiction, but the armor described in it does exist. It is said that whomever wears it gains such vitality that it seems as if they have achieved true immortality.",
