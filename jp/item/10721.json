This pelt doesn't come from a particular animal, but is instead a combination of multiple animal pelts fused together, born from the development of new technology. Originally, special pelts where required to perform certain incantations and exorcisms, but since it seems that this synthetic pelt can be used for a large number of those rituals, many sorcerers and dark magicians use it.
