Based on that legend, this crystal was named the \"Phoenix Eye.\" It wasn't clearly known how this crystal, which enhances the vitality of living creatures and increases their recovery rate many fold, was produced. For that reason, it has come to be speculated that it was formed from a crystalized Phoenix eye."
