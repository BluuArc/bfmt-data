Amongst them was the staff Kortz Lezetta, which was sealed in the utmost depths of a sacred territory and guarded by the 12 Guardians of the Gods. However, it is said that no one knows the whereabouts of the staff after the 12 Guardians' insurrection. If it were to reappear in this world again, it would most likely bring with it a whirlwind of chaos."
