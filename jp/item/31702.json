It was used to aide allies against monsters during missions, but it was originally created for the purpose of subjugating monsters. Because of this, its ability for rapid-fire was quite impressive. However, the gigantic size of the barrel and the huge amounts of ammunition required to fire this gun were considered quite the problem, and thus it had very few admirers."
