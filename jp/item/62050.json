It encapsulates divine power inside a sinister exterior, and is believed to have the power to place mighty curses upon opponents who attack its wearer even as it protects them. It is said that the demons of ancient times produced countless demonic armaments, and created it as an experiment to combine their own dark powers with the divine powers of disciples. However, the specifics of this remain unknown."
