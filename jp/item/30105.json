However, a cavalry leader with a shield on his hand recognized the assassin, and without a moment to lose, shot the assassin to death full of arrows, and the assassination attempt was thwarted. From that moment on, this shield came to be used as a tool for condemnation, with its punishment provided by the emperor's archers."
