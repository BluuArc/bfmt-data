		"lore": "There was once a high ranking god who became interested in the things that humans produced. Though imperfect, he admired the effort they put into their trades and decided to fool around by trying to make a piece of armor himself. The armor he made shone brightly, and its special powers prevented it from suffering any damage, or even being destroyed. One could say that this amazing piece or armor was born from the boredom of a god."
