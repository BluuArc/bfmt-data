It was passed down from the hero's mother, a magician, and a guiding light stone fragment is embedded within it. The hero always held it and prayed for victory before major battles, but normally kept it hidden under his armor to prevent its discovery by his younger sister. However, he was unaware that his younger sister also possessed a similar, moon-shaped talisman."
