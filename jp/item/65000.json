		"lore": "This blade was made from materials gained from the wicked dragon Avlansch, who was created out of concentrated water magic by Natra, the deity of shadow. With its flowing curves and clear blue-white blade, many who look upon it are struck with awe. But the blade still holds the evil spirit of Avlansch despite its beautiful appearance. Accordingly, it is said to have the terrifying power to paralyze anyone it cuts via its inherent freezing temperature."
