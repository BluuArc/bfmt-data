		"lore": "A pearl passed down among the Guardians of Meirith from generation to generation. A holy relic granted to the first Guardian by the Holy Emperor himself, the pearl was normally kept under lock and key and only taken out for special rituals. It was even used in the Guardians' succession rituals, in which it is believed that new Guardians would touch this pearl. Doing so would awaken the Guardian's latent powers, and simultaneously instill a deep-seated reverence for the Holy Emperor."
