		"lore": "A fragment of the accessories worn by the two gods who served Karna Masta. It is thought that the fragments were scattered when the two gods engaged in a heated battle with a certain Summoner. Even separated from its owners, it has lost none of its shine. Although it is only a fragment, an undeniable feel of divine authority continues to dwell within and it conceals a strong power of purification. For that reason, the wicked are considered unworthy to even touch it."
