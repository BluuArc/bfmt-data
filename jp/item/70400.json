The aroma from this incense incites one's fighting spirits, and has the ability to increase one's attack power on the battlefield. Since one mistake when using this incense can lead one to go berserk, the common folk, and the usual Summoner are forbidden to use it. However, due to its effective properties, there are probably Demon Slayers out there at this very moment surrounding an incense burner in order to prepare for the battlefield."
