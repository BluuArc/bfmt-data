Many suffered due to various plagues and diseases that ravaged the country before its completion, but it eventually came to be called a masterpiece of the highest quality due to its ability to bring its wearer's potential to extreme limits. It is said that as its name suggests, no matter how many times the wearer is taken down, they will rise like the phoenix once again."
