		"lore": "A lock of hair from the head of the War Demon Shusui. Its never-fading hue is the vibrant color of fire, and has the ability to psychologically entice the fighting spirit of any who look upon it. It is said that this lock of hair has the ability to awaken the hidden potential of whoever possesses it, rapidly developing their abilities on the battlefield. On the other hand, since Shusui's will still lives within it, its owner is also said to have an unquenchable thirst for fighting strong opponents."
