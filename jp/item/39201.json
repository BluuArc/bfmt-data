The two fell in love, but when the goddess informed him that she had to go back to the far away country she had come from, she left the Gold Bangle she wore on her left hand behind with him.  After that, any injuries that the soldier suffered were completely healed in a short amount of time, and is known as the hero who averted death time and time again."
