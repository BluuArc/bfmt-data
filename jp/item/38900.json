		"lore": "This was the most ordinary gun in the world. One would load it with normal bullets, and then pull the trigger like with any other gun. However, something strange happened to the body of the person shot by it. It caused numbness, weakness, and sometimes loss of the function of the joints. At the beginning it was believed to have been just bad luck, but some found it strange when it continued to happen countless of times. Thus, the rumor of the cursed gun that could damage the soul was gradually spread."
