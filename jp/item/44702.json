Another of his orbs from the \"Heresy Series,\" its purpose of \"increasing the survival chances of the wearer\" is very similar to that of the Fallacy Orb, though it uses an entirely different approach to do so. With the ability to anticipate disasters before they happen in order to avoid them, it also boosts the basic abilities of the wearer."
