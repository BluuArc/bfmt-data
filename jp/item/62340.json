Although he always showed an almost divine prowess in battle thanks to the blessed ring that protected him, one day the powers of said ring vanished, and he was struck down by the enemy on the battlefield. Some claimed that Alces met his doom after failing to pay tribute to the gods, but a high priest that examined the ring he left behind claims that Alces simply transcended the boundaries of mortality."
