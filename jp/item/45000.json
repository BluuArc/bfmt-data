Certainly ancient, this weapon suits its owner well, though no one knows where in Grand Gaia he found it. No legends mentioning Ishrion have been left behind, and the other Summoners of Old will not speak of it either. Because of this, many rumors claiming that it hides the secrets of the gods, or that its true shape may not be a weapon still circulate to this day.",
