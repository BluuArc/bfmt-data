According to legend, an individual wearing this armband appeared and led many people to a new promised land when a cataclysm befell Bariura. Its only proven ability at present is the tremendous enhancement it provides to its wielder's defenses, and some suspect that even its existence was unknown outside of a few members of the imperial family."
