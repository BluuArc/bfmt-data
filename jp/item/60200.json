		"lore": "An orb modeled after the Twilight Stone carried by the Guile Demon Mora. It is capable of awakening latent abilities of its user to call down the crushing power of twilight upon enemies. Although spherified, the stone is thought to possess its own will, and the user must exercise great caution to avoid spiritual erosion while in contact. It is said that only Mora, whose overwhelming willpower allows her to dominate and control the minds of others, was able to reach a mutual understanding with the Twilight Stone and unleash its true power."
