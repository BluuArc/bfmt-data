	"lore": "Originating from an ice beast with a shell similar to that of a turtle, this material is attracting attention due to its dullness. Ice beasts use these claws to cross over frozen lakes and to climb cliffs, surpassing the shell when it comes to durability. Thought it is hard to construct anything out of this material, any armor made from it will maintain its efficiency for the same amount of time that some turtles are believed to live for hundreds of thousands of years.",
