		"lore": "Small, carnivorous insects native to the world of Vilanciel. Their forelegs have developed into blade-like shapes, and groups of the insects are said to use them to burrow into icy surfaces to attack small animals hiding within. Their hard exoskeletons are excellent materials for equipment and polishing weaponry, but react to heat by softening quickly. Accordingly, extreme care and refined techniques are both required for their processing."
