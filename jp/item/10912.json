		"lore": "For a certain period each year, the world of Vilanciel has nights during which the sun never sets. The insects known as Midnight Bugs sometimes appear in great swarms during this period, and are said to shed huge quantities of scales as they fly about. The scales are poisonous, but magic users who see the insects always run out to collect them due to their value as magical materials."
