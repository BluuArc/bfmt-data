		"lore": "The dark purple vines that envelop Mordlim. They are self-aware, despite being plants, and have been seen to act on their own in concert with Mordlim's will. Owing to the otherworldly sap contained within the plant, humans caught by the vines find themselves disabled by unfathomable terror. Many scholars use these vines, which regenerate no matter how often they are cut, as materials for researching otherworldly technologies."
