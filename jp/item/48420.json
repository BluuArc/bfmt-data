Able to reflect the deeds of whomever looks upon it, the mirror is said to have been used by the fairies to judge those humans who wondered into their forests. Legend has it that when the God Army invaded the fairies' home, their queen decided to fight back after the mirror showed her the beautiful reflection of a young man resisting their attack."
