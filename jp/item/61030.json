The Holy Blade is said to have been crafted using Zergel's most refined techniques, therefore it was said to possess a power pure enough to vanquish evil. However, this led many swordsmen to fight over it due to that very reputation, and in the end, Zergel sealed the Hallowed Blade away to prevent a war over it."
