		"lore": "A potion distributed by the Akras Summoners’ Hall. Despite looking like a Cure, it’s actually far more potent, creating the same effect in much smaller doses. Its light weight makes it easy to carry, and it’s often distributed to Summoners before they depart on long missions. Details on how to mix it are closely guarded by the Summoners’ Hall, making it difficult for normal people to get their hands on."
