		"lore": "The Licresya flower that blooms near holy shrines was only known to others through ancient myths. Considered the epitome of beauty, many artists exhausted their talents to create decorations for the gods in hopes of persuading them to bring the flower back. However, the first time any human actually laid eyes on this blossom was during the war. This flower that grants more power to its owner was painted on the flags carried by the God Army, bringing nothing but despair to the human race."
