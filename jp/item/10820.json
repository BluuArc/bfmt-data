		"lore": "A long time ago, there was a beautiful crimson phoenix which had pledged its service to a goddess. The phoenix granted its divine protection to the goddess over the span of many years, until a demon appeared from another world and ended the goddess's life. Mad with anger, the Phoenix pursued the demon back to its world, and achieved vengeance in exchange for both of its own wings. Unfortunately, however, the Phoenix was unable to return to its home without the ability to fly, forcing it to live in solitude in the demon's world until nothing but its vibrantly colored bones were left."
