		"lore": "When this sphere was first discovered in Ishgria, it was in such a terrible condition that it didn't even serve to create a prototype. However, few could have guessed how truly formidable it was, as it not only has the ability to predict incoming attacks, but also to reduce the damage they inflict. Furthermore, though many things concerning the dark arts remain a mystery, the ones found within this sphere seem to help the wearer's body to endure the strain it places on it. "
