		"lore": "Granomus travels underwater in disguise, appearing suddenly underneath one's feet. It has been a mystery for some time as to how this monster knows where to show himself without the use of his eyes nor ears. Once the Demon Slayers took a lot of this material home with them, they discovered that the monster can move by sensing vibrations through its skin. According to newly collected data, the crystallized shell of this creature has the ability of sensing magical powers, though no demonstrations of this have been given as of yet."
