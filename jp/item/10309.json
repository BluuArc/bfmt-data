	"lore": "Smoky-looking drops that release a putrid gas, occasionally found among special fungi clusters across Grand Gaia. They have the rare properties of sublimating into a gas upon impact and blocking out magic, and thusly are incredibly unstable. The Summoners' Hall has long since established a refinement technique and the Demon Slayers have been actively using said technique, though details of which have yet to be disclosed to the public.",
