		"lore": "Summoner Lugina's beloved sword, made from the bones of an ancient dragon. The magic embedded in this blade gives it the ability to react according to the strength of its owner. For this reason, it releases an incredible force when its wielder is dominant on the battlefield, while it becomes extremely dull when the same is in a grievous predicament. Due to the difficulty of its use, some advised that the sword be reforged, but Lugina took it for himself stating that he never falls into mortal danger on the battlefield. "
