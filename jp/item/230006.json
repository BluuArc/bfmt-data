		"lore": "There once was a knight who lived in a faraway land. This knight wore a ring that symbolized the love and affection he shared with the pixie Nallia. This ring also endowed him with the power to recover from any wound. He used the ring's magic to win glory in battle, and on doing so, he became engaged to the queen of the nation he served. However, on the day of their wedding, he removed the pixie's ring. In that instant, the nation's enemies stormed its gates and annihilated it completely. The pixie's ring has not been seen since."
