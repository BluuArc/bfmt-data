		"lore": "The fang of a ferocious and carnivorous beast that inhabits the Principality of Vriksha. This animal's jaw strength is such that it often chips off, or breaks its own fangs as it masticates its prey. For this reason it is quite common to run into this creature's broken teeth, and are thus often used as materials to create weapons. However, there are many who invade this beast's territory unprepared and end up losing their lives in the process. Therefore, great caution is needed when searching for this particular material."
