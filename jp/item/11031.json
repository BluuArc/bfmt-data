		"lore": "According to the extensive report filed by the Demon Slayers after Mistzug was defeated, a doubt has arisen about its origins. Though mere speculation, the demon currently known as Mistzug may be different from the mythical creature it was originally believed to be. The two are indeed similar in some ways, but the description given of Mistzug is too vague to know for sure. There are even legends that say this demon was not originally from Grand Gaia in the first place."
