		"lore": "Van Lucy's internal organs are structured in such a way that it is difficult to believe they belong to a living creature. Even what are assumed to be its bones all resemble different mechanical parts of a contraption. On one end the bone is very thin, while the opposite end expands widely. It is said that this screw-shaped bone still has traces of Van Lucy's cylindrically shaped muscles attached to it, as well as pieces of its rock-hard skin."
