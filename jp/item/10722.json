		"lore": "Ancient Bariuran folklore tells of a beast which was invisible. The reason for its invisibility was believed to be its possible ability to mirror its environment, or perhaps the ability to refract light using water vapor. When the pelt of this legendary beast was finally discovered, it was found to have scales like that of a fish. The key to its capability to disappear may lie within these."
