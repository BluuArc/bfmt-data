		"lore": "Once there was a country that witnessed a shower of stars. Their fall is said to have led to the blooming of flowers in the desert, and even the purification of toxic lakes. Thereafter the king sent his men to every region in the land to investigate this phenomenon. They found what was apparently a fraction of one of the fallen stars, and its composition and shape were made of minerals unknown to the region. Believing it to be a gift from the gods, the king placed the stone upon his crown, and established a peaceful reign that would last for over 18 generations."
