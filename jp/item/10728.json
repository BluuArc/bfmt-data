		"lore": "When a high number of demons started pouring out of Ishgria, a scale that can't be seen with the naked eye was discovered as thorough research was conducted on Claudalus, a fire-clad dragon which had been just recently defeated. The scale's extremely high temperature make it impossible to hold with one's bare hands, and it is believed that more information on the mysterious land of Ishgria could be obtained by finding the reason as to why no other individuals who had previously defeated Claudalus were unable to collect this item until now."
