		"lore": "A plant native to northern Elgaia. It's more effective than Green Grass, but it's also hard to cultivate and thus not very common. It's used in making High Cures, but as it's hard to synthesize, only the most experienced can deal with it. It's native to Grand Gaia, and has been found in the Morgan region."
