It radiates a unique light, and when struck is said to show living beings in the vicinity, visions of the past and future. The true nature of the crystal's power remains unknown, but it is almost definitely linked to the existence of Amu Yunos. Some theorize that it results from the aftershocks of her powers reverberating in materials nearby at the time."
