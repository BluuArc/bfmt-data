		"lore": "There once lived a lord who was loved by the people of Alzeon. However, his land was also ravaged by the gods, and, unable to fight back, his people lost their lives. Hearing the dreadful screams of his people, the lord grew angry. His rage endlessly pouring into the pearl he wore, it suddenly exploded, incinerating the gods along with the rest of Alzeon."
