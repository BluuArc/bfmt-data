Any man who wears this girdle will gain the strength of a savage beast and set unprecedented records. The original gladiator was eventually granted an audience with the empress, but vanished mysteriously several days later. The girdle was later taken up by the next champion, but it is said that its color had changed to a dark red at that point."
