Though it always held potent magical energies, it is said to have gained even more power when Lucana received her oracle. There are grand tales of Lucana defending the people from all manner of attacks from enemy gods over their long journey. Similarly, it is said that its mysterious powers inspired hope among the people even after their arrival in Elgaia."
