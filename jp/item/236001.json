		"lore": "A sacred mirror given by a god in recognition of a country's royal family. That family is thought to have been entrusted with the country's governance by the god, but its authority declined with each generation. In the midst of this decline, the country was invaded by a demon and plunged into crisis. The emperor by that time was merely an ordinary person, but seemed transformed and displayed astonishing ability the moment he looked into this sacred mirror. He is said to have gone on to command an army and successfully drove out the demon."
