	"lore": "A crystal embodiment of dragon energy discovered in Valdroar. They are always discovered in pairs, though the reason for this is unclear. With a sharpness that has led to them being mistaken for dragon fangs at first, they can even be used as a powerful weapon depending on the size. Their use as a material is still at the trial stage, but it is hoped that someday they may be used to harness the immense power of dragons for personal use.",
