		"lore": "An internal organ believed to be Van Lucy's heart. Overflowing with evil power, liquid still flows through it even after its owner's death, somehow managing to retain its warmth and pulsations. It is believed that if the working mechanism of such an organ could be discovered, it would prove to be very beneficial for the advance of Elgaia's technology. However, if the divine blood within the heart all flows out, it will stop beating."
