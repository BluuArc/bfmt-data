Loved by many of its masters, this axe would unknowingly reach into their subconscious, its destructive power growing ever stronger in order to protect them. However, these masters drunk with power became overconfident in their abilities, and began seeking meaningless fights. This only served to shroud the axe Agreious in deeper darkness still."
