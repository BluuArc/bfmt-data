Rumor has it that the Savat people from the Sama Kingdom often used this stone in battle during the times of the great war with the gods. It is also said that when a certain general of the Sama Army found himself cornered by the God Army alongside his soldiers, they miraculously found an escape route that brought them back home alive after using the stone."
