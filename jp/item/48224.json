The plants that grow from this variety of seed grow at more quickly when damaged, and their essence grants the sphere heightened regenerative powers. Noel remains dissatisfied with its abilities, however, saying, \"Someday I'd like it to grow fast enough to cover an entire island.\" He is rumored to be at work on improvements."
