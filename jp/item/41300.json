		"lore": "The following folklore has been passed down in the Agni Region. It is said that when selling one's soul to a demon in order to attain revenge, a voice will call one's name on a moonless night. Guided by the voice, one will reach a sword. This sword is called the Lament Blade, and it is said to cut as sharply as the pain felt by the wielder. The tale of a blood-drenched ogre swinging this sword to get his revenge has left many children trembling violently."
