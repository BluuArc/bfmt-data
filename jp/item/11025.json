		"lore": "An empty crystal that although solid, contains no solid ingredients within. Regardless of its existence being thought impossible by current physics' standards, the beautiful structure of this crystal is made of an extremely rare substance. Ironically, the beauty of this crystal was deemed as a symbol of avarice by many countries in ancient times, which led them all to refuse approaching the Item. Even clergymen strongly disliked it, regarding the Empty Sphere as a symbol of depravity."
