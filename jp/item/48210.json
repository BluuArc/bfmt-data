Possesses the ability to reflect malice and ill-will directed at its wielder by heightening their spiritual power. The technique used in its creation involved the Summoner projecting uncertainty and fear through training. However, due to fears that the training could not be completed owing to the intense burden it placed on the Summoner, these plans were suspended."
