The black conqueror dragons native to this land do not maintain a single den; instead, they wander night after night, driving away enemies. Once, a black conqueror dragon set foot atop the peak of the sacred mountain and was struck by lightning from the purplish clouds enshrouding it. It is said that the dragon was instantly slain, leaving behind only these silver-white fangs."
