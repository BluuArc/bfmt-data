	"lore": "Called the nut of the backwoods, it is a mysterious and rare organ from the shining dragon Laguna Rex, which can be seen releasing light in various occasions. This organ, which shines just as brightly as a scale of the dragon itself, has completely different properties than the regular nut of the backwoods. Detailed information about it will come from further research, but according to the hypothesis of a certain scholar, a surplus of vitality might be accumulated in this special nut.",
