Everywhere his troops lay foot gave way for mounds of corpses as they set village after village on fire till they were reduced to ashes. His subordinates did not enjoy performing such cruel acts, but the more they continued following these orders, the more they lost their reason, plundering and slaughtering everything in their path. The bloodbath that ensued after smashing their enemies into bits drove the soldiers onto their next battle."
