It's said that when Owen defeated the beast, this sword appeared from the remains. Medblare harbors tremendous destructive power. The blade is imbued with the demon dragon's hellfire, and is capable of reducing the most terrifying monster to embers in an instant. According to rumor, Owen has never let another lay a finger upon his prized weapon."
