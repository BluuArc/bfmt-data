		"lore": "Sinister armor sealed deep within the underworld. It enhances its wearer's physical capabilities immensely while also granting limitless regenerative capacity that can compensate for any injury. However, these benefits come at an incredible cost; the armor absorbs life energy from all surrounding beings during combat. It is entirely capable of reducing a verdant field to a lifeless wasteland. It is also said to make its wearer enamored with death in battle, sentencing them to a life of endless combat."
