This small sword, which was kept in the treasury of the Atharva Republic, is believed to have been part of the Nine Sacred Treasures themselves. Having played a crucial part in establishing the republic, the successive rulers of Atharva have been known to say throughout history that even if the republic were to fall, the treasure must not be lost. However, there are no witnesses who can attest to the existence of this blade."
