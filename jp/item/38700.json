		"lore": "An alchemist once created a demon tool which had the power to awaken a person's dormant potential. After a strange series of events, it found its way into a god's hands, who became surprised when he saw how much human crafting skills had progressed. The demon tool was eventually returned to the alchemist, but it was not the original demon tool any longer, but a divine tool upgraded by the god. No one knows if this was meant to serve as encouragement for humans to aim higher, or if it was a warning from the gods."
