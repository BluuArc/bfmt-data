		"lore": "A charm shaped like a key that a Summoner of Old is rumored to possess. Once this charmed is used, it opens a portal to another world, where the Summoner may seek further assistance. Every time this Summoner is asked about the key he always makes up excuses, claiming not to know anything about it, or saying that he has lost it. Because his answer varies every time he is questioned, many believe the rumor of the key to be true, speculating that the elder is just trying to hide its existence."
