		"lore": "According to the account of a Summoner who fought Balmedia, the hairs on its mane stood on end thanks to the high voltage electricity that ran through it. However, the pelt that he managed to bring back from his battle did not have such properties. Detailed studies are yet to be performed, but it is speculated that the mane turned into thunder itself, rather than the electricity being an added property. Not much is known about this particular Item, but many hope it will prove useful for future inventions."
