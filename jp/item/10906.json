		"lore": "A bug that can camouflage itself, adapting to everything. Though there had been several eye-witness accounts in Mirvana, many remained skeptical of this insect's abilities until it was finally captured a few years ago. On its own it doesn't have much of an effect on the sphere making process, but when combined with other materials, it synthesizes easily to raise beneficial effects and is thus regarded as a valuable material."
