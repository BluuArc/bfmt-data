		"lore": "A shield born from the World Tree such a long time ago that it is hard to tell exactly when. At first glance it seems to be a shield made of wood, but its durability surpasses that of steel and black diamond, and it is even said to be better than the scales of a dragon. It is said to have been given to a hero before the Battle of the Gods, but there are no records of the hero using such a shield, though it is supposed that he passed it on to his descendants."
