		"lore": "There once was an otherworldly kingdom named Akbutecca. In that kingdom within a world already completely destroyed, there lived a famous general called the “Sacred Shield.” He took on otherworldly invaders, and making full use of all types of military tactics and strategies, he thwarted every line of attack and eventually forced them to abandon the invasion. It is thought by some that the people of this kingdom knew of a secret ritual to inherit souls, and the general's soul is said to pass into whoever wears this crown."
