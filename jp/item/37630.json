		"lore": "A long sword used by Selena, one of the Six Heroes. Passed down through generation after generation of the people of Savat, it's said that whoever holds this sword is their leader. Though this beautifully crafted slender blade may look like a mere decorative piece, it is in fact far more powerful than your average sword. It's told that the sword has a will of its own, and that in melding with Selena herself further drew out her powers."
