The tale states that long ago a ferocious god from another world appeared in Grand Gaia, challenging the gods who resided there to battle. After a tenacious fight, the otherworldly god was repelled by the gods, and this blade is said to be the only thing that it left behind. Though this story is believed to be a fabrication, it still doesn't explain how Vriksha came into the blade's possession."
