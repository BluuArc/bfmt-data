		"lore": "A gem said to have been enshrined somewhere in the underworld. It is believed to have been created by a demon who concentrated the vestigial powers of dead gods and disciples into it. However, that demon is said to have been absorbed by the gem as well. Its wielder will gain incredible power, but a normal individual's spiritual strength cannot withstand the lingering will of the gods that went into the gem's creation. Such an individual would be instantly crippled in attempting to use the gem."
