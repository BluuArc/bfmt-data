		"description": "An incarnation of the power of Darkness from another world. Legend has it these beings are the key to unlocking powers greater than those of the gods. On another world, an experiment was conducted to agglomerate high volumes of darkness. Trying to condense the dark power into negative levels, it gave birth to beings from naught. The experiment was then deemed a failure, and the creatures that resulted from it were sent back to the void they had come from. Today, darkness has the power to lay things to rest, allowing souls that have preserved their power to sublimate onto a higher plane. If one is able to control the power of a Mecha God, the power of limitless Darkness may become theirs.",
