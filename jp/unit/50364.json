As Crystal Gods are far rarer than Metal Gods, there has been conflict over their existence until recent years due to few witness reports. After their existence had been proven, they were initially recorded as a subspecies of Metal Gods, but they were completely different creatures despite their similar appearance. It is said that Crystal Gods organize the records held within Metal Gods, then systemize and refine the information.",
