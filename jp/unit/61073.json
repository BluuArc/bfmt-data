Stories tell us that she once lost a battle with a monstrous beast that attempted to devour children, and that we now see her form corrupted by evil energies. Not only have her appearance and nature changed considerably, but she also retains little of her original personality, causing her to attack any humans she sees now. Even so, witness accounts tell us that she has never attempted to harm a child under any circumstances.",
