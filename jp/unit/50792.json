Having inherited an ancient tablet from its ancestors, it keeps it under close guard to prevent it from being stolen by its natural enemy, the Emgif. It is said that this tablet contains many secret techniques sealed within it, and that whomsoever is fused with it gains the same mysterious abilities. Very rarely spotted in nature, many consider the Elgif to be a good omen when they make an appearance. However, they do disappear when they gift others with the techniques in their tablet. ",
