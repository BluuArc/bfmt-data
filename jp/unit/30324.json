They seem to be able to communicate with Earth Ghosts, who are known for their reticence, solely by gaze. Due to that, they attempt to communicate by gaze with others as well, only ever saying \"It's fine, it's fine. You don't have to say a thing.\" It has been said that gazing into one's eyes instills a sense of recognition and positivity. However, there are a few rare rumors saying that they don't really think of anything and have no intention of listening to anyone.",
