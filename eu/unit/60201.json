Completely aware that Summoners are after the pot it's in and not the creature itself, once captured they develop a totally negative attitude. Regardless of what kind words one uses in addressing them, they always respond with \"Either way, you know it's not ME you really want...\" leading many to give up consoling them altogether. ",
