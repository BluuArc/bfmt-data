They're energetic and often cheerful, but due to their sometimes excessively high energy there are quite a lot of Summoners who are annoyed by them. Despite their cute appearance and bright personality, one must take extra caution when attempting to capture one as they attack fiercely when confronted. It seems they lose all of their energy if the horn on their head is touched.",
