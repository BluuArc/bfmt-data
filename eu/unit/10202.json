Known for their offensive way of speaking, they constantly vilify Summoners they come across before quickly running away. Because of this they are rarely seen, but they're also hard to forget. The element of fire is much stronger in them than in normal Metal Ghosts, and it's said that when fused to other fire types they provide loads more experience as well.",
