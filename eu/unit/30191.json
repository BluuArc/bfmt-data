It's said that Earth Pots were used as cooking pots by chefs in the past, the trauma of which has left them fearful of coming in contact with fire. The lack of interest they have in how highly they're sought after by Summoners nowadays have left modern chefs wondering exactly how badly they were treated by chefs before. ",
