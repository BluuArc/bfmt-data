A little overconfident in their own strength, they constantly seek to absorb others, though usually end up being absorbed themselves. Their job is to move matter from point A to B, and they are known for their ability to prevent the degeneration of their cargo. This ability causes them to permanently raise the Energy of their hosts. Some have been spotted continuing to do their jobs around Elgaia to this very day. ",
