They are good listeners, which make them very well-liked among the talkative Metal species. They seem to enjoy listening and give exaggerated responses, but appear to forget everything a couple of hours later. They are more than happy to listen to the same story repeatedly, but they fail to remember the important facts, therefore it is believed that it's impossible for them to keep promises.",
