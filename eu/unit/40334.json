After being clustered in ridiculous amounts by beings who hoped to evolve, the thunder gained a will of its own, giving birth to a rebellious Mecha God. And so, the creators decided to destroy the Mecha Gods they had given life to. Today, the thunder's said to help purify souls before they are sublimated onto a higher plane.
