		"description": "An old legend passed down in Elgaia tells of a strong frog who shares a similar story to another creature there. According to the legend, when the gods used their powers to create the world, one being meant to keep their remaining power to himself. Trying to use such power for his own personal growth, rather than for the world's, the gods punished him by transforming him into a frog. Even as a frog, he still yearns for the power of creation, and thus is always targeted by others. When used as an ingredient for Fusion, it may lead to surprising beneficial effects.",
