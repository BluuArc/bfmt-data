A researcher has estimated that their memory capacity is no larger than that of a Metal God. However, where a Metal Unit lacks in the capability to process repetitive entities, Crystal Units are able to precisely organize such records. The density of the information they hold is said to be the reason why more experience can be gained out of them despite similarly reported capacity attributes.",
