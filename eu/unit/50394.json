Though their existence is shrouded in mystery, it is believed that gods from another world created these creatures to escape their own destruction. However, the light proved to be too strong, ironically serving as a catalyst for the destruction that was to come. Today, the light helps to cleanse the soul from any unhappiness before it sublimates onto a higher plane. If one is able to control the power of a Mecha God, the power of limitless Light may become theirs.",
