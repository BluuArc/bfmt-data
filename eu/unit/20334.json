They always appear to be in a foul mood and no one understands what they're always ranting about. Asking them about it only stirs more trouble, and even troublesome Water Ghosts try to put on a smile to cheer them up. However, whenever they notice that their companions are not truly listening, they get even more upset and leave without a word.",
