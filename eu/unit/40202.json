Though they're thought to be ferocious due to them being of the thunder element, they are calm and speak with composure which causes some Summoners to walk away in pure bewilderment. The element of thunder is much stronger in them than in normal Metal Ghosts, and it's said that when fused to other thunder types they provide loads more experience as well.",
