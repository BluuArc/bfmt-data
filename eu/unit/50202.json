It is called the most unlucky of the metal record species, and not just because of the amount of knowledge it holds within itself, but also because of the various things that come out of its mouth. The element of light is much stronger in them than in normal Metal Ghosts, and it's said that when fused to other light types they provide loads more experience as well.",
