They're known to speak in a particularly crude manner, though it's rumored that this is only because they're actually shy and simply unable to express themselves otherwise. They show particular resistance when first encountered and great effort is required in capturing them. However, it seems they'll let those to whom they open up to touch the prized horn on their forehead. ",
