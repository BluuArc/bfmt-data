One must be patient in keeping company with them as they often complain by saying things like \"I like cool places but I hate the cold,\" and \"I don't like my food too hot or too cold.\" The element of water is much stronger in them than in normal Metal Ghosts, and it's said that when fused to other water types they provide loads more experience as well.",
