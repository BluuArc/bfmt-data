Contrary to Jewel Gods, it fuses the precious jewels it ingests and makes beautiful stones unlike anyone has ever seen. It has so many precious stones in its stomach that their glow is manifested even in its outer appearance. One can sell this god for a lot of money, but to buy one, one must be a millionaire. ",
