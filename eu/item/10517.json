Once a month the demon moon glows in a purple hue during the dark of the night, calling forth a pack of ferocious wolves that are said to devour anything in their path. The torn fangs of these wolves are a testimony of their battles against demons, though having hidden demonic powers of their own, these fangs deliver a devastating blow when sunk into their prey."
