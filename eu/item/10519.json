Believed to be one of the sources of the Mystical Wolf's power, it is also said to grant its bearer power that rivals even the gods. However, the fangs are not easily obtained, as they are symbols of Vilanciel's ruler, most believe that the Mystical Wolf only grants them to those it acknowledges as powerful foes in battle."
