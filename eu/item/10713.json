		"lore": "The fire clad dragon's temperature is unusually high. The temperature of the scales that its skin is covered in can cause severe burns on the frail skin of a human in a split second. Even more surprisingly, this skin has the ability to maintain the same temperature even after the dragon has died. If one were to implement this material into making equipment, it would probably have wonderful results. The subjugation of this dragon, however, is no easy task."
