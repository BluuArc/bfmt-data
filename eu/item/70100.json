The special smoke not only obstructs one's field of sight, it makes it impossible to detect any scents or traces of magic as well. Unfortunately, as its effects affect the senses of its user as well, it can't be used in ambushes, and is only useful for escape from tough enemies. When faced with a formidable monster, sometimes retreating is the only option."
