The queen prayed to a goddess to show the king the error of his ways, and was granted the Lotus Manuscript from on high. The queen then gave the king this piece of writing, which is said to have changed him dramatically after he finished reading it. Realizing the importance of defending his land, he shifted focus from conquest to strengthening the nation itself."
