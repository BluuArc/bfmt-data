	"dictionary": {
		"lore": "According to studies conducted by Summoners' Hall, the thunder beast this heart belongs to is believed to have incredible amounts of stamina. This beast is able to run around the mountainside for seven straight days without resting once. The source of the endless stamina it holds seems to be connected to the electrical charge it carries, which may be causing its heart to behave erratically. It is speculated that this electricity causes the heart to keep beating infinitely, giving the beast unlimited energy."
