	"lore": "Long ago, wars of a large scale took place in the region of Agni, where the ancient Agni Empire once stood. This crystal can be found in the ruins of those ancient battlegrounds. There are those who simply believe it to be an ore, but scholars refute this by claiming that it does not normally occur in nature.
