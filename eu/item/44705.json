Its primary function is to maintain the magical and mental power of the one who equips it, and thus contains a mechanism that allows it to encircle the wearer in a magic-enhancing barrier. Due its ability to redirect the excess power emitted when the barrier is expanded even further, this device can hugely increase the user's fundamental abilities."
