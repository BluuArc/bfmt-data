Though the material it's made of seems no different than any other metal, inside it are intricate parts that flash intermittently from time to time. It is also unbelievably stark, though it bears many scars and signs of melting--indications that that Duel-GX was once caught in a very fierce fight. Story has it that this fragment with the words \"No. 1\" carved on its backside belonged to the daughter of a prestigious household."
