The tribe passed down this sinister, misshapen helmet from generation to generation, and its chieftains always wore it while leading at the battlefront. The tribe's soldiers would gain absolute confidence upon seeing this, as it symbolized their people. Meanwhile, it is said to have instilled the fear of death in enemies and weakened their morale."
