Some of the magicians who witnessed this battle were so impressed by the armor of the ice beast as it grew thicker while it was damaged, that they risked their lives to uncover its secrets. However, humans were unable to reproduce this power from the gods, and its research was shut down prematurely. Nonetheless, one of the techniques created during this process gave birth to this incredibly hard and rare armor."
