It is said to hold all of the knowledge of its home world, and to grant wielders instant knowledge of all actions required to disable any foes they face. Realizing that the world died because of this weapon, the god sealed it away deep within his temple. It is said that even when war broke out between humanity and the gods, he did not permit the seal to be broken."
