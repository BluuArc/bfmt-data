According to a legend inscribed on a stone fragment, whenever the knight raised his flag beams of light would shine down from the heavens, and those following him into battle would be led to victory by the great power and courage it granted them. The whereabouts of this flag were unknown until a certain piece of information was found claiming that a disciple had taken possession of it. Without any further details, however, that claim remains disputable."
