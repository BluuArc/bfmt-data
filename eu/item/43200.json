This legendary crystal, and the incredibly demonic power that comes with it, is said to have originated from the heart of an evil fiend that proved to be trouble even for the gods. All in all, this crystal has only been found in legends, and thus its existence can't be proven. However, no one can deny that its name appears multiple times throughout many chronicles.",
