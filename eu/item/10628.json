		"lore": "A jewel the size of a fist said to grow within Grudkia's body. Regarded for its extraordinary beauty, it is considered a valuable ingredient used to forge high quality armor. However, being very fragile in nature, the jewel usually breaks into pieces when fighting Grudkia in hopes of obtaining it. Therefore, more than needing strength to win against the beast in battle, it is said that what one really needs is a stroke of luck in order to collect it."
