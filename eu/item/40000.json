It would fire up the heart of whomever equipped it, making his desire to fight boil endlessly with excitement. However, how this machine came to be upgraded even though its design wasn't fully understood, still remains a mystery. It is believed that perhaps the people building it at the time thought it incomplete and kept adding to it, giving the appearance of having been upgraded."
