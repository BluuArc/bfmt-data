	"lore": "A beetle that mainly eats gold dust. They store up all the gold they consume in their body and it's said the more they eat the brighter they shine. Those that are especially bright are very popular and are used as ingredients in valuable spheres. However, they develop a black tinge when startled, so one must be careful not to excite them when capturing them as their value will drop.",
