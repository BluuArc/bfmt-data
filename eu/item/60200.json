Although spherified, the stone is thought to possess its own will, and the user must exercise great caution to avoid spiritual erosion while in contact. It is said that only Mora, whose overwhelming willpower allows her to dominate and control the minds of others, was able to reach a mutual understanding with the Twilight Stone and unleash its true power."
