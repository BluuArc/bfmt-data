Eons ago, when Grand Gaia knew no heaven or earth, nor even the names of the gods, the light of a brilliant spirit from another world appeared in Grand Gaia. Using the Amenonuhoko it created various islands, and the humans that would encapsulate other spirits shortly after. This legend is based on a story from another world, however, and its degree of authenticity remains unknown."
