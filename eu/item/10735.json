		"lore": "A strip of cloth from the raiment worn by the demon Mora. Woven of precious enchanted silk, it enables the owner to release their true magical potential. Remarkable for its beautiful shimmering golden pattern, the cloth has a faint, captivating scent. It's thought that the cloth's scent is responsible for the lingering fragrance left in the air after Mora passes by. Notably, the magic butterflies that live in Ishgria are drawn to this scent."
