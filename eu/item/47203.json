Being the most gifted warriors in the whole of Grand Gaia, they were admired by the people, and were the only ones allowed to carry proof of their status as holy guardians. However, when the great war with the gods broke out, they were separated into two factions, pinning themselves against each other. After the battle, this Sphere was found split in half on the battlefield."
