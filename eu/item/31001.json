Though it doesn't compare to the original, it still boasts powerful abilities. However, much like any reproduction it lacks stamina and cannot be used for long periods of time. There are some who even say that it is not a mere reproduction, and was in fact built as a catalyst which draws the actual force from which it was created from the other world.",
