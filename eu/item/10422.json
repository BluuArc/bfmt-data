		"lore": "The claw of a massive earth dragon native to Estria. These earth dragons have undergone partial mineralization, and aside from the fact that they make their homes primarily in caverns deep underground, their life cycle is shrouded in mystery. Their fangs and claws are extremely hard and a substantial amount of energy can be extracted from them. One theory holds that these properties are due to the influence of the energy reserves that lie underground in Estria."
