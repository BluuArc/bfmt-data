	"lore": "The durable pelt of a thunder beast admired in secret by many for its hue, texture, flexibility, and tough properties. Since the number of Summoners who can actually defeat the beast this pelt belongs to is very limited, it makes it that much more exotic and appealing to others. However, since the possibility of this Item becoming available in large quantities is quite low, researchers are not showing much interest in it.",
