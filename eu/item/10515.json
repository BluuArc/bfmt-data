		"lore": "A fang that Granomos uses as it navigates underground to turn rock solid surfaces into tiny grains of sand. First studied by the Demon Slayers when they brought it back from a land survey, this Item was deemed to be designed for digging by their experts. In current research these fangs are used as a model to create new digging equipment, though many more of them will probably be needed in order to keep the studies going."
