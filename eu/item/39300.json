The gambler tried to trick the stubborn god with his words, but in the end played right into the god's hands, and was manipulated by him. However, this covenant god had such a serious sense of duty that he offered the spoils of the bet to the gambler anyway. It was a pearl that could increase spiritual power, and it is said that years later, the gambler became a highly regarded priest. ",
