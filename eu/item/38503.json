It is only as big as a fist, but it accumulates all of the magic and miasma floating around it to construct to a protective wall. Condensing more magic than what the usual human gets to witness, it protected the demon from everything in battle. However, since this demon always fought in the front lines, his shield was eventually taken away by a hero, and thus made its way into human hands."
