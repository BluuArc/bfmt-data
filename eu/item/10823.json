	"lore": "This fossilized bone was found in front of a great shrine in Ohbanahara. It is unclear what sort of creature the fossilized bone originally came from, but it retains a wondrous spiritual energy. Some say they can sense a white-hot energy radiating from within it. Some researchers believe that it is a fossilized bone from the fire god worshiped at the grand shrine. Opinions remain mixed, however, due to the extreme scarcity of evidence.",
