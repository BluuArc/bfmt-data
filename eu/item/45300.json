Able to sense when the wearer is in danger, the armor is said to have the ability to boost its own defenses. Once the armor was taken from Grand Gaia to Elgaia, rumor has it that its power was sealed away. However, some say that when a certain warrior was finally able to gain self-control by facing his past, the power of the armor was released anew."
