Though it has no capabilities for defense, it does have the ability to recoil attacks suffered by the wearer. This crystal was manufactured with the intention of having inexperienced soldiers equip it, who would then serve as physical counters for attacks suffered from the God Army. However, many denounced this intended practice as inhumane, and production of this crystal was halted after a few prototypes were made."
