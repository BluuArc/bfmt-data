Legends hold that this superior weapon was used during humanity's initial flight from Grand Gaia, and that it is now kept under heavy security by the Imperial Guard. The will of past wielders to protect the people has been infused into this blade, granting it power worthy of its title as a sacred item. This blade holds the power to turn the tide of any situation."
