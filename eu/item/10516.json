An excessive amount of literature had to be consulted in order to determine whether it was an entirely new type of beast, or perhaps and unknown demon. No myths have been currently found to mention the creature, though a supposed forged tome mentions a white wolf from another world which appears to pass judgment. There are many people who claim that the creature mentioned in the tome could be none other than Balmedia.",
