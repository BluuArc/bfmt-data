After the battle amongst the Guardians' two factions, this Sphere fragment was found on the battlefield along the Guardian Shard. Though it looks like the two connect to form one original Sphere, the damage and dirt on their surfaces suggest that they are parts of two separate different entities. The reason why only half of each Sphere was found remains a mystery."
