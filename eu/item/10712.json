	"lore": "In contrast to their appearance, the wings of the demon Reduhark are very flexible and can be easily cut by the kinds of weapons that the gods tend to circulate. However, if a wing were to be cut off, it immediately produces darkness that coagulates wherever it lands, perhaps making it impossible to flee from this demon. Being an extremely rare material, whoever wants to get his hands on a full wing from this demon will have to take him down in his entirety.",
