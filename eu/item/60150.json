One such individual holds that the Sacred Treasures were not created by the hands of any individuals, but rather that they are manifestations of the will of the world itself. This staff is known by the name Telra Eden, and almost resembles guns used in other worlds. Rumors hold that it will appear to humanity shortly before the end of the world."
