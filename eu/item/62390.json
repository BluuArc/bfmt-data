As all of these prisoners died with peaceful expressions on their faces, in time it came to be revered as a sacred object. However, it was later discovered that the whip was a profane relic that heightens suffering and madness in those it strikes. It was then promptly sealed away, deep underground. One theory holds that a certain queen was involved in the whip's creation."
