The stone only forms deep within the belly of an aged Giant Rock Turtle. It took the combined effort of the members of Rih'alnase to crack open the belly of one such turtle, which mistook the curious Librarian for it's dinner. Having earned the respect and trust of Rih'alnase, the gemstone has been bestowed upon a summoner who has earned the respect and trust of the wondering band of misfits. "
