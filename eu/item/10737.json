	"lore": "A fragment from an inner wall of one of the massive caverns found in Rokkzalm. A researcher who noticed the magical energies of the cave brought this back from an expedition, and its analysis has produced fascinating results. Specifically, it has shown that it is something like a film of magical energies accumulated in the cave over countless years, eventually forming numerous layers and strata. It would be reasonable to assume that there are many similar locations throughout Rokkzalm, but confirmation of this supposition will require additional surveys and research.",
