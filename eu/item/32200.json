It usually takes the form of a shield, but once equipped it absorbs the power of its user and a magic veil forms and envelopes the user's body. The veil protects and boosts the user's defence against all attacks. However, mass producing it proved to be difficult, making it a rare item that only a few institutions in the Empire could own."
