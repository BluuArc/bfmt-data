Made from precious ores and purified by shamans, they are later passed on to individuals by the tribal chieftain as part of a coming-of-age ceremony. As the white ogres hunt with light equipment, these gauntlets are ideal for defense without sacrificing agility, and for reducing weak points. They are also said to have increased the white ogres' success in hunting in hilly areas and forests."
