Then one night while visiting a forest to collect material for arrows, he was struck by lightning. He raised up an arrow which split the lightning in two, and upon realizing he was safe he was overcome with happiness. He had infused his arrow with magical powers. At last he had both a bow and arrow infused with the power of thunder."
