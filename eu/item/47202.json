Its inner workings remain unknown, but it is said that when this sphere is placed within a lifeless doll, the doll begins to move as if having a will of its own. One theory claims that the sphere is the work of a demon father who sealed his own soul within it in order to look after his daughter even after his death, but no proof has been found to support this claim."
