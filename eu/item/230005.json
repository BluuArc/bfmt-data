She went on a hunger strike to save her people, praying for them, and dying before her time. The gods that pitied Tracion bestowed a charm upon her adherents. Legends hold that the people's hearts became tranquil and they ceased their violence against one another when Tracion's adherents presented it as an offering at the temple."
