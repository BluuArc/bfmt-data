		"lore": "Insectoid automatons are sighted frequently on the world of Bectas. The wings stored in their hardened exoskeletons give off an otherworldly light in dark locations, and their beauty in groups is said to defy written description. However, there have also been reports that seeing this light renders humans unable to retain their sanity. The world currently awaits future research reports in order to determine whether the automatons' light is helpful or harmful to human bodies."
