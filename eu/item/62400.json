It was said that she could fire at an enemy locked in combat with an ally in a chaotic melee, and always strike only the enemy without fail. She only grew more accurate with each foe she slew, and she left the battlefield strewn with a corpse for each arrow she carried. As she put it, so long as she had a trusted friend to work with, she could slay any foe.",
