		"lore": "A sacred bow bestowed by the gods upon a young man who loved nature. The defensive sigil inscribed in the wood protects the archer who wields it, and its arrows are said to hold a wide variety of natural powers. The young man's descendants took up the bow in turn, but its power gradually faded as humanity began to grow apart from nature. Furthermore, tales also tell us that the bow was feared and despised as a portent of destruction after the gods began their offensive against humanity."
