It amplifies the wielder's offensive power, then stores the energy that is produced and converts it for defensive purposes. Many of the researchers viewed it as an excellent Sphere for both attack and defense. However, Noel is said to have been dissatisfied, calling it \"imperfect\" because its defensive powers are dependent on offense.",
