Most of these trees grow to be grass, but they all have the same qualities regardless of what kind of tree they bloom from. Its true nature is unknown, but it is believed to be a type of fungus or parasitic plant that serves as a catalyst for magical ingredients. Thus, if one comes across it, it is best to collect it."
