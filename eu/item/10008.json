		"lore": "This spirit grass is native to the world of Rokkzalm, and is rich in magical energies. Its roots are far longer than its structure on the surface would imply, making the grass impossible to dig up while Rokkzalm's enchanted puppets interfere. One theory among researches is that Rokkzalm contains veins of magical energy deep beneath its surface, much like natural springs in Elgaia. The theory elaborates that the grass absorbs and stores this energy using its long roots. Experts anticipate that further exploration of Rokkzalm will provide a definitive answer."
