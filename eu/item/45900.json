Information about them has been kept well hidden, but according to the discovery of a notebook belonging to a high official of the Agni Empire, he had witnessed the Sacred Axe with his very eyes while it was still in its safe. However, after having laid eyes upon it, he wrote that perhaps his life was now in danger. Strangely enough, the date of this entry in his notebook coincides with the day a famous tyrant abdicated the throne.",
